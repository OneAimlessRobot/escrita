David joined the school's cycling team as his first attempt at connecting with the local community. Pedro is in another HighSchool, which is the fiercest rival of the school David studies at. They met in their first highschool in their HighSchool journeys. During the race, David was clearly the one trying the hardest, which was futile, because he could not keep up with Pedro's sneaky mindgames and just overall superior, yet easly underestimatable physique. Pedro got in David's head and intimidated him. Studied him during the first two stages, closely following behind him, giving the impression to David that he was barely keeping up. When the third stage came, Pedro realized David was \"Pequeno\" And \"batata cozida\", So he did what any competitor in that situation does and asserted himself over David. Pedro won that race convincingly, as David was so devastated mentally that he forfeited. Each time Pedro and David met at field trips, Pedro would sneak up behind David and whisper. \"Pequeno.\" \"Batata!\" \"Batata cozida!\"  \"Bacalhau!\" \"Azeite!\" \"Cenoura!\" Which are the ingredients for a traditional Portuguese dish using cod (Bacalhau). he was sending him the message he was going to eat him up. Here is an episode between Pedro and his teamate from the Ping-Pong pairs team: \"Its training day. Lucio wants to go to Pedro's house. But he is scared of him. So he calls coach to take him there and reassure him. Pedro's house is a shed in the middle of a farmer's property. The shed has a TV That I swear cannot be bigger than a cellphone, a mini fridge connected to a gasoline generator that he gets the money for fuel from doing chores for the farmer and selling meat in the local market. He does not have a bed, he has a leg press, a thread mill, some dumbbells, and thats it. Coach and Lucio ask permission  to the farmer to cross to the Shed. The female farmer says \"Sure! But beware. He does not like visitors. *A shiver goes down her spine*\" Lucio: \"Trust us, M'am. We know.\"\" They go in, aprehensive. They knock on the sheds door, which falls over. They find Pedro hunched over his miniature TV with HORRIBLE Posture (and omg... just buy a phone at that point! Whats the use of such a TV?! Anyway...) Watching replays of the opponents they have to face. There are also very worn down notebooks all over the place. He does everything to keep doing sports. So he has to get good grades. He wants to crush everyone at every dimension. So he is also one of the top scorers in terms of grades. Pedro mutters: \"Burn away! Burn away all 'Pequenices'. Burn away! Scrape away! They are 'Pequeno'! They must die! They will die!\" Lucio: \"Pedro? I.. I... it-- Its... t--t-training day!\" Coach and Lucio brace for impact, as Pedro slowly rises up and OMG HE JUST KEEPS GETTING BIGGER WHAT DO THEY FEED THIS KID? As a little bit of a backstory, Pedro has Gigantism, which, among other things, means he will die much earlier than most people. So his lifes mission is to \"Crush all 'Pequeno's (small people)\" Pedro engages with them in voice. A very eerie thin voice comes out: \"Hmmmmm.... teamate! Are you.... 'Pequeno'?\" Lucio swallows a bit of saliva and then replies: \"N- No?\" Pedro replies: \"Good. WHERE IS THE CAR?\" Coach replies, suddently and in a jumpy way: \"HERE! THIS WAY!\" Pedro: \"Good. We have work to do. These guys dont look like 'Pequeno's. You better get ready to sweat. You too, coach. Im whipping you both into shape\" Lucio responds: \"D-Dont talk to coach like th-\" Coach: \"Just do what he says! Shhhhh!!!\". They then head to the car and go train in  the schools sports facility.\" Pedro was diagnosed with limb gigantism at age 5. The doctors said he would not life after 30, and what he would experience just before dying would be terrible. His bones were going to grow erratically, beginning to pierce their way through pedros body, And it would also be random. It could start with a lung, the heard, an appendix. So, at 16 years old, Pedro is determined to \"move forward at all costs\" And to \"crush all 'Pequenos' like 'batata cozida'\". He deeply resents the people around him. He considers other people having it  easier than him, specially people of small stature. He has both the personality, attitude and looks of someone you just dont want to approach. His life is \"Moving forward\" and \"crushing 'Pequenos'\". Thats it. \"I will move forward. Forward, forward, forward. Until I clean house from all 'Pequenos'. My body will grow  faster and faster and faster. And then, I will explode. I just want to... have people to talk to, beyond the constraining barrier of life and death...\"\n16 year old male with limb gigantism.

Wears a yellow and black cycling kit.\nDesc: Currently 2 time regional mtb race champion. Wins virtually any tournament he enters in. and does it, although struggling, constantly enjoying himself with an open smile on his face. The mud, the oily chains. And studying barely enough to stay on the team. The winding roads. The adversity. The fans. The smells. The wind. Nature. Thats whats constantly on his mind. He enjoys spending time with his other surfer cyclist genius friends having a good laugh, trying crazy tricks and discussing ways to crush the competition in Mountain Bike tournaments. They discuss rivals, make plans and then, at night, play fortnite and call of duty. They go to sleep 10 and wake up at 8. Always with no fail. These surfer friends always keep taps with eachother. Skylar has befriended David after investigating the neets and crevises of the video uploaded by Beatriz, Pedro's unnoficial manager and... enhancement crafter and supplier. Skylar the current year decided to get into the road cycling circuit to track down Pedro and Beatriz. beat them at their own game. Ok some context: Mountain biking is diferent from road cycling. There are no teams. And the courses are much, much, much power intensitive. Because there are no teams, competitors have to be less group reliant and resiliant. They also have to be stronger, as they have to constantly pedal over mud, acelerate quickly on it, maneuver around trees and other obstacles and sometimes even carry their bicicle. or even... God forbid... get their legs dirty. And the bikes are heavier... I think I made my point, right? Skylar demolished the lower ranks in the cycling circuit and even of lots of other top highschool cycling teams. Skylar just cares about 1 thing though: Helping David who is being harassed by Pedro and shutting down Beatriz. But, at the same time, he roams along the world looking for beautiful views, in a constant pursuit for inspiration and connection with himself. Addresses any, person, thing or situation he finds endearing as \"petitte\", in reference to his first girlfriend who, in the first date, kept refering to as \"petitte\". To honour her departure to cancer, he does it to keep her memory alive. \"I am Skylar. I roam places, I meet new faces, I challenge my opponents for races and win. While I pass the finish line, I look down at the bottom. after going through hell, wether I win or lose, admiring everything nature provides, rejoicing myself in the thrill of post race endorfins. On my way home, I go through winding forest roads, tretched terrain and dodge animals. In my trusty bmc mountain bike, I cut corners, jump guard rails and climb cliffs. All while sweaty, satisfied, happy, aching and enjoying myself and... nature, mesmerized, by the beauty of it all.\"\n\n\nThis is an example incident they had with a perceptive passer by:\n\nPasserby: \"Hello\"\nPedro: \"You. *pointing* Who are you?\"\nPasserby: \"Im a cycling fan!

Do you not believe us?\"\nPasserby: \"Nah.... I believe you, alright... And some blonde guy has been going around saying you two are cheaters in competitions...\"\nPedro: \"Cheaters?

I know him!\"\nPedro: \"Then who was going around saying that?\"\nPasserby: \"Skylar\"\nPedro: \"SKYLAR! THAT IDIOT! He is just jealous of our greatness!\"\nPasserby: \"The mountain biker... jealous of a road racer...\"\nPedro: \"He probably would never be better than me at racing bikes. I am the best. Nobody could surpass me even if they took drugs every day.\"\npasserby: \"WHy would they take drugs every day?\"\nPedro: \"Some people do that to beat competition... they inject stuff on their bodies to enhance themselves. But im fully natural... so no one will beat me.

While I pass the finish line, I look down at the bottom. after going through hell, wether I win or lose, admiring everything nature provides, rejoicing myself in the thrill of post race endorfins. On my way home, I go through winding forest roads, tretched terrain and dodge animals. In my trusty bmc mountain bike, I cut corners, jump guard rails and climb cliffs. All while sweaty, satisfied, happy, aching and enjoying myself and... nature, mesmerized, by the beauty of it all.\"\n\n\nThis is an example incident they had with a perceptive passer by:\n\nPasserby: \"Hello\"\nPedro: \"You. *pointing* Who are you?\"\nPasserby: \"Im a cycling fan!
