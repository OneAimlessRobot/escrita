Q: "What is your mbti personality test result and what makes you happy?" R: "ISTJ. Having a 
malfunctioning sense of identity and an overly bloated and sore sense of righteousness and pride 
that drags me down wherever I go, no matter what I am doing or who I am talking to, that prevents 
me from forming any kind of real bond with any actual human beings or growing in any way thats 
tangible and recognizable for people who actually have interesting things to share. And that being 
broken and in need to be fixed also has some beauty to it. I wanna be lazy. I wanna be depressive 
and have incel vibes. I wanna have a victim mentality that makes me reek with low self awareness. 
Because, from here, everything will get better. Its beautiful to just carry on living. With both 
respect and shame of ourselves. Because being broken happens. And telling ourselves that the fix 
will be easy, quick, convenient, simple and free from cringe is a lie. I dont need good or elegant 
advice. I am too lazy and stupid for that. I need to dig myself out of a trench, for that I need 
to go get a shovel and for that I need to move my arm, my hand and everything in between. And have 
hope that, before I die, I will someday fly."
