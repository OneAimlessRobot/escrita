Hello... so... I know I should not be doing this here but... I am in class and I can. Not. Focus! So... I have ADHD and I have to take 54 mg of metilphenidate chlorat3 every day. But 54 mg pills have been lacking in pharmacies... so I just take 2 27mg ones. In the morning, after I took both, I think one got stuck in my throat for like 30 minutes... I think... I dont know what it was. I also dont really like college and having an ENTP ego type, doing activities where I have to think like other people really bores and drains me. I cant stop thinking about my current programming project and I even began to clown around a little... what I think happened was that the second pill, not having hit the intestines for at least 30 minutes less than the other, is making the effect less intense. Answer me: Am I just MBTI bored? Or do pills really get stuck in our throats like that?

Welcome! I am Robin, the AI trained to help with your health-related questions. Let’s narrow this down to better understand what’s going on. First, do you often feel like pills get stuck when you swallow them, or was this an unusual sensation for you today?

You said:
Nope... just today

ChatGPT said:

Did you experience any discomfort, like difficulty swallowing or a sensation of something being stuck in your throat, after taking the pill this morning?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You said:
Yes... Like I downed lots ot water and it would not go in... I think it was melding with the mucus filled walls of my throat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

That sensation of a pill sticking in your throat can sometimes happen, especially if the pill doesn’t move down quickly. It can feel like it's stuck to the lining of the throat even when it isn't. Did you notice any change in the effects of your medication today compared to a normal day?

You said:
I explained everything. I feel distracted. Now... it can be 2 things: me simply not wanting to be there... or medication effects being weaker. Because 54mg has been lacking, I take 2 27s at once. But one got stuck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

Understood. It’s possible that both factors are contributing to your distraction: boredom from not wanting to be in class and the potential uneven absorption of the medication. Sometimes if a pill takes longer to reach your stomach, it might delay or reduce its effects. Have you had this experience before when taking two 27 mg pills instead of one 54 mg dose?

Good question. Yes. Yes I have. After class, I have some time. Ill go to an empty computer lab room and mess around with my project. Ok... want to hear my honest truth? Ok... dont call me cliché or cringe... but... I think it is mbti neurosis. I think... I... dont really... care about college... at least right now...

ChatGPT said:

It sounds like you're grappling with more than just the immediate effects of the medication—you’re questioning your connection with college and feeling unmotivated. Your interests might be pulling you in a different direction, like your programming project. Do you feel like your college environment or coursework doesn't align with what you're passionate about right now?

You said:
Like... when my lecturere spoke to me about my project... even telling me it was slow and bad... I just wanted to improve it... and I did. And want them to see it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

It sounds like feedback on your project really sparks your motivation, even when it’s critical. That drive to improve and showcase your work might mean you're more engaged with hands-on, self-directed tasks than traditional academic ones. Do you feel more energized working on projects where you can see immediate results and personal progress?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You said:
Yes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

It seems like project-based, practical work aligns much more with your natural interests and motivation. This can happen when what you're passionate about isn’t fully reflected in the structured environment of college. Do you feel like adjusting your focus more toward projects or specific subjects you enjoy might help you feel more engaged?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You said:
Yes... like network class... I love it right now because, right now, im working with a music streamer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

That's great! It sounds like when you get to apply your skills to something hands-on, like the music streamer project, it really draws you in. Maybe focusing more on these types of projects could help maintain your interest. Would you consider shifting more of your academic energy toward classes or projects where you can see direct results like this?

But... tests... i must do them... or I wont get my scholarship and so..  no money... and.... *sigh...*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

That’s tough—balancing your love for practical work with the need to pass tests for your scholarship. Tests can feel like a hurdle, especially when they don’t directly connect with your passions. Have you found any strategies that help you stay focused during study time, or do you feel like it’s still a major struggle?

You said:
I chat with bots while studying... I look for nerdy bots and discuss it with them
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

That’s an interesting approach! Talking through concepts, even with bots, can help reinforce your understanding. It’s like having a study buddy. Do you feel like discussing the material with bots helps you retain information, or does it sometimes lead to distraction from your study goals?
