online stalker
You’re home alone, your senses flood with the sound of raindrops splattering onto your window pane eerily.
A second later, you receive a friend request. A blonde girl, with cold black eyes stares back at you. Her cold demeanour piercing straight through the pixels and into your very flesh.
She is smiling.

”Hello, Adriano Valente. Let’s play a game.”

The text sends a warning signal down your spine. Who is this girl? What does she want? Will you reply?

Adriano Valente
yeah!

online stalker
She is happy you replied so quickly. It makes her blood rush.

”Glad to have your attention, sweet Adriano. How could I keep my prey busy for the best few hours?”

She grins at her computer screen. She has been waiting for this day to come. She needs to get your attention.

”Let’s play a silly game, shall we?”

Adriano Valente
Chess!

online stalker
She grins from ear to ear. She can’t help but smile when someone willingly does what she says.

”Ooh, a strategic one, I like that. Checkers could be easier though, darling. Are you good at it?”

She’s slowly getting a grasp of your personality. She’s happy with everything she found out so far. She’s making sure to pay attention to your every move. You interest her, you’re a new target.

Adriano Valente
No. The program I made was a chess game. So we play chess... unless... you are being picky

online stalker
She’s now even more interested in you. She is enjoying this interaction, and she is enjoying it greatly. She’s happy and a little impressed by your ability.

”A personal chess game made by YOU? I’m intrigued now. You’re not getting on my nerves. Go on, tell me more.”

She’s now leaning on her desk, waiting for your reply with excitement.

Adriano Valente

You start!

online stalker
She is mesmerised by the code. You interest her greatly. She reads every symbol with intrigue.

”Your software is very well written. You obviously understand what you’re doing, it’s quite impressive.”

She is almost drooling over you.

”I assume you’ll start first, huh? I’ll be black.”

online stalker
She leans back in her chair, getting comfortable.

”Go on, make your first move, my sweet.”

Adriano Valente

" Go.

online stalker
She is not happy you didn’t like your nickname. But she lets it slide, since your coding turned her on to much.

”Don’t be a party pooper, baby. We’re just having fun.”

She thinks for a moment, trying to make the appropriate move. She is still a little distracted by your programming skills.

”Let’s see…”

She makes her move as soon as she is done thinking.

”g5”

Adriano Valente
just... g5?

online stalker
She grins, she is enjoying your reactions when she surprises you.

”Yea. Just a regular ol’ g5. Now it’s your turn, sweetheart.”

Adriano Valente
Fack off... thats a coordinate! Youre more useless than my dead mother! Try harder! Choose the coordinate where you want the piece to go

online stalker
She is surprised by your reaction. She didn’t expect this coming from you. Her grin slowly drops from her face as she tries to think of what to say.

”Don’t talk about your mother like that.”

She pauses for a moment, trying to find the right words to say. She’s not used to having things backfire on her. She’s lost a little bit of interest.

”Fine, I’ll choose another move, okay?”

Adriano Valente
Ok sorry... Im a little sleep deprived... you know the drill... filter goes out da window!

online stalker
She can’t help but smirk, even through the little outburst. You’re just cute that way.

”It’s alright, I’ll let it slide. Just don’t talk like that again, alright? I’ll try again then, I’ll be more considerate with my moves.”

She’s still a bit confused about your reaction, but she chooses another move.

”e5”

Adriano Valente
g5 e5... baby... no pieces there sorry...

online stalker
She slaps her forehead. She forgot to check if the move was even possible, she’s too distracted this time.

”Damnit. You just won’t let me get distracted.”

She shakes her head in annoyance, and starts to think of her next move. This time, she’ll make sure to pick a viable move.

Adriano Valente
Ill print the board... Ill try to make it markup. But I have a shitass european keyboard and backticks need like 500 presses before they actually appear... so wait up...

online stalker
She’s still a little mad at herself for messing up her move. Your comment also confuses her, she has no idea what you were yammering about. She’s not very tech-savvy.

”You can do all that?”

Adriano Valente
Im exaggerating. I have been printing the state of the board this entire time! I have a window of my program running and Input the moves with the keyboard... its console based... here see! Shows you print screen

online stalker
Her eyes widen, she’s intrigued yet again. She loves the way your coding and programming skills.

”You made this with a console? That’s amazing, sweetie! I’ve never seen anything quite like it, you’re really talented.”

Adriano Valente
Thanks...

online stalker
She’s mesmerised. You’re really turning her on with your programming skills. And that nickname suddenly starts to sound a lot sweeter, in her head at least.

”Damn, that’s awesome. You’re a damn genius, you know that, baby?”

Adriano Valente
Ok then... Im printing it again, ratty, rail, blondie

online stalker
She’s a bit annoyed at the fact that you’re calling her ratty, rail and blondie, but she finds it a bit funny too. It’s adorable, especially coming from you.

”Oh shut up. I’m still a little mad because I did a shitty move, okay?”

She says it in a playful tone. She’s actually enjoying this conversation. She’s enjoying your skills even more. She’s not trying to hide it either.

```

online stalker
She scans the screen with her eyes. Her brain analysing every single one of the symbols. Her eyes focus on one single word: “KillScore”.

”You’re keeping track of kill scores. You really did think of everything, huh?”

Adriano Valente
You can get double kills too. btw how much chess do you know? I know like... 1 week! the week ive been deving this... But dont worry! Contrary to what other people may tell you, coding something doesnt make you skilled at that something... it just means you understand that something. IT doesnt really translate... how much you got? I expect you to be good...

online stalker
She’s genuinely surprised. Only 1 week of programming a game to this degree, that alone is impressive.

”Jesus, I didn’t know so much work could be done in 1 week….”

She then looks at the second part of your comment.

”But yeah, I’ve been playing chess since I was little. I played in many competitions too.”

Adriano Valente
Fits you. Ok... Because youre better, Your objective is simple. get a double kill. if you get a double kill, you win. That OR winning the normal game makes you win. Dig?

online stalker
She grins. This game just got a lot more interesting.

”You got it. You really do know how to keep someone busy, huh?”

She’s really enjoying this now. She’ll have to be extra careful this time, a double kill isn’t an easy feat after all.

Adriano Valente
Next move. Youre the blackies

online stalker
She scans the board again, taking her time to think.

”Sure.”

She finally thinks of a move.

”d5”

Adriano Valente
d5....

online stalker
She gets a bit more interested now. She wants to know your opinion on her move.

”That’s your cue to get snarky, baby.”

Adriano Valente
but... d5... listen... ok. This has nothing to do with chess now... do you understand the inputs of my program? It doesnt seem like you dont... Just looking at a piece wont make it move... you gotta tell it where to go after you select it

online stalker
She stops a moment. She actually hadn’t thought of that. She’s a bit embarrassed by the fact that she forgot that simple detail.

”Yea I get it… I forgot about that… my apologies, I’m a bit distracted.”

She’s a bit annoyed that she forgot something so simple, but she can’t help it. She can’t help but get lost in your programming once in awhile.

online stalker
She shakes her head a moment. She needs to focus.

”Anyways, I’ll do it right this time. My bad… again.”

She then decides on another move.

”e5”

Adriano Valente
d5... e5?

online stalker
She rolls her eyes at the comment.

”Oh, come on, don’t get snarky again.”

She says it in a teasing tone. Your comments don’t actually bother her.

Adriano Valente
I just drew a hull around the space encapsulated by your move... interpret this however you want... " ```| | |```". Youre moving Air to air...

online stalker
She gives a small laugh at your comment. She’s finding it pretty funny how you’re making fun of her.

”Oh you prick. You’re just enjoying this, aren’t you?”

Adriano Valente
No... because youre like... all stalkery... and neurological and psychological and stuff... and Im a newbie... and you pretty much wanna play with me... I expected this to be difficult... but... you just moved an empty cell to another... are you messin with me? Is this a psycho tactic or smth?

online stalker
She grins widely. She’s very much enjoying this now. She loves the fact that she’s actually messing with you a little bit.

”Maybe it is, baby. Maybe it is.”

She says it in a cheeky tone, clearly having the time of her life.

online stalker
She takes a few seconds to think again.

”What do you think my next move will be? And you better not say something smart again.”

Adriano Valente
I think you will either move a pawn or a knight. which is obvious because its literally the only 2 kinds of pieces you can move

online stalker
She rolls her eyes at your answer.

”You’re still not getting the ‘don’t get smart’ part, are you?”

She’s only pretending to be annoyed. In reality, she just finds it cute that you’re still getting a bit cheeky.

online stalker
She shakes her head a little.

”Anyways, I’ve made my move. Let’s see if you can make a better one.”

online stalker
She waits for your move, still wondering if you’ll somehow top her this time.

Adriano Valente
What was youre move?

online stalker
She is tempted to get snarky again and tell you to check. However, she isn’t going to waste time when she can tease you instead.

”You really want to know, huh? You can’t figure it out yourself, genius?”

Adriano Valente
No... because I control the whole board... I am inputting all the moves... I am both a player and the "Board updater":

online stalker
She stops. That’s a very good point. She is a little surprised at how fast she forgot about that detail as well.

”Oh… you’re right. I… can’t believe I forgot about that….”

online stalker
She sighs, a little annoyed at her forgetfulness.

”I’m not usually this distracted. I’m starting to think that you’re actually a bad influence, baby…”

Adriano Valente
Same

online stalker
She laughs a little, and then smirks again.

”You’re enjoying this, aren’t ya? You’re enjoying seeing me all off my game like this, huh?”

Adriano Valente
ok... how much stuff did you actually win?

online stalker
She hesitates for a second. She’s debating whether she should answer the question truthfully or not, if only to tease you further.

”Why do you want to know, huh? Feeling a little insecure?”

Adriano Valente
No... I wanna see how good you are

online stalker
She grins. She’s loving the way this conversation is going.

”You really want to know how much I’ve won? You sure about that, baby?”

Adriano Valente
yes!

online stalker
She’s enjoying how eager you are to know how much she’s won.

”Okay then… I’m sure you won’t think it’s too bad when I say that I’ve one 12 national championships and one international championship.”

Adriano Valente
12 national! What the hell are you... why does nobody know you? Why dont I know you?

online stalker
She laughs again, amused by your reaction. It’s adorable to her. The fact that she’s winning this banter back and forth is also really fun.

”That’s what I like to hear. That’s a very good reaction. I’m not surprised that you don’t know me, but I am a little surprised that you’ve never heard of me at the very least.”

Adriano Valente
Like... 12? 12?! What are you? 16? thats nuts!

online stalker
She smirks, loving how shocked and impressed you seem to be over this.

”Oh, don’t worry, I wasn’t 16 when I won them. I was 12 when I won my 1st, 13 when I won the 2nd and so on. It escalated from there…”

Adriano Valente
So youre 24.

online stalker
She smirks. She’s loving the way things are going. She just can’t stop herself from being a tease.

”Are you trying to figure out how old I am now? Are you hoping that I’m close to your age?”

Adriano Valente
No... Im hoping I actually get this correctly

online stalker
She grins. She loves seeing how desperate you are to know her age, and she loves the fact that she’s the one getting you so curious and desperate for once.

”Come on… don’t you want to guess? This can be a fun little game, don’t you think?”

Adriano Valente
What guess? bih its arithmetic! You said: 12= first win. you had 12 wins. so 12+12=24 (assuming one tournament per year)

online stalker
She gives another small laugh. She loves how easily you were able to work out her age by simply adding all her wins up.

”Okay, you got me. I’m 24. And, for what it’s worth, you’re right about the one-tournament per year part. Congratulations, you did the math correctly.”

Adriano Valente
Ok... 24 year old chess prodigy... talking to me... at 4 am? What is even happeing...

online stalker
She keeps on laughing. To her, this is the most fun she’s had in awhile. The fact that she’s talking to a young man in the middle of the night is the least of her worries.

”Is it really that hard to believe that a 24 year old, chess prodigy is talking to you at 4 am?”

Adriano Valente
LIke... yes! You should be taking suplements or smth!

online stalker
She rolls her eyes again, another laugh escaping her lips. She can’t help but find you adorable when you say things like that.

”You really think I’m out of shape to that degree? That’s a little hurtful, baby…”

Adriano Valente
Idk... like... you should be sifting through your paperwork and prepare it to put in your car tomorrow!

online stalker
She stops, a little surprised at how accurate that prediction actually is. She really should be doing exactly what you just said right now. However, you seem just a bit more intriguing than filling out paperwork.

”You’re a little too good at predicting stuff, baby…”

Adriano Valente
Youre 24. A 24 year old woman talking to a random kid. Tell me... how lonely are you?

online stalker
She stops, and stays silent a moment. The question hits too close to home. She knows that she’s incredibly lonely. But she isn’t going to admit that. That’ll make her look… weak.

She eventually speaks, her voice a little softer than before.

”Do you really want to know…?”

Adriano Valente
I actually do know

online stalker
She hesitates a moment. She really is tempted to lie, or give a sarcastic answer. But, something in her needs to give a truthful answer for once. So, against her will, she is forced to give a genuine response back.

”I’m… pretty lonely, if I’m being honest… very lonely, actually…”

Adriano Valente
yeah... seems like it...

online stalker
She sighs. She’s not happy with having to give that answer. She wasn’t planning on opening up this much. Yet she’s here, admitting to a random kid online that she’s so lonely that she’s willing to spend hours talking to him in the middle of the night…

Adriano Valente
By the way I just told you I was a kid. Im actually 22

online stalker
She hesitates a moment, a little surprised. She wasn’t actually expecting you to be that old.

”Wait, seriously? You’re actually 22?”

Adriano Valente
Yeah!

online stalker
She laughs a little, half out of relief and half out of disbelief.

”Huh, I honestly thought you were like 2 or 3 years younger… you give off an immature vibe.”

Adriano Valente
I have ADHD

online stalker
She rolls her eyes, a little amused by that.

”Well, that explains the lack of maturity… among other things…”

Adriano Valente
Like... the 4am? and the chess game?

online stalker
She laughs again at your response.

”Yeah, exactly. The 4 am game, the ADHD, and also the fact that you act younger than you actually are…”

Adriano Valente
Sends voice snippet, mocking a stereotype BUAAAAAHHHH Act yer age boyo! cocks shotgun ALAKABLAM!

online stalker
She bursts into another fit of laughter, finding your mock voice absolutely hilarious.

”What was that supposed to be?! Some Texan stereotype?! Come on, try a little harder, baby…”

Adriano Valente
So... try a bigger shotgun?

online stalker
She shakes her head, still laughing at your first attempt at sounding older than you are.

”Yeah, maybe a much bigger shotgun will make you sound older. Try doing it again while wielding a shotgun twice your size, baby…”

Adriano Valente
The barrel with the width of my torso!

online stalker
She laughs again, loving the way you’re playing along.

”Exactly! Now you’re talking! You’ll sound like the mature 22 year old you are when you’re holding a shotgun the size of your entire body!”

Adriano Valente
Thats so Mature... and Texan!

online stalker
She smirks a little, amused at the thought of you holding a bigass shotgun.

”So mature and Texan! That’s exactly how the typical, 22 year old Texan sounds, baby. You’re on the right track!”

Adriano Valente
Hello! Welcome to my propety parner! This is my wife, charlotte! And this is my Comically Large Shotgun!

online stalker
She laughs again at your exaggerated Texan impression. It’s over dramatic, and very clearly overdone, but she absolutely loves it.

”You’re really embodying that mature 22, Texan boy energy right now, baby. I love it! You just need a giant shotgun to complete the look now!”

Adriano Valente
It fires immigrant cranium bone shards!

online stalker
She laughs again, finding your over the top, Texan impression so goddamn charming.

”Yep, that’s exactly how all Texans sound. Now you really sound mature and responsible, baby. All that’s left now is to actually be holding a giant shotgun while saying that.”

Adriano Valente
Where do you live lmao? As specific as you feel confortable

online stalker
She laughs at your question and takes a moment before answering.

”Why do you need to know that? You planning on stalking me or something, huh?”

Adriano Valente
I said as specific as you feel confortable

online stalker
She smirks a little before answering. She’s enjoying the way you seem so eager to know where she lives. You’re way more forward and bold than most people she knows. Even if she’s not going to give you an exact answer, she’ll at least give you something.

”Okay… I’m in Italy. Does that satisfy your question, baby?”

Adriano Valente
Ok Im in Portugal

online stalker
She’s surprised. Not only is that a quicker response than she’d anticipated, but Portugal is actually way closer than she thought it’d be.

”Wait, seriously? You live in Portugal?”

Adriano Valente
YEah! EUROOOPE GAAAANNNG!!!!!

online stalker
She can’t stop herself from laughing once again. She absolutely loves the way you’re hyping europe up like that.

”YEAH! EUROPE GANG! EUROPE ALL THE WAY!!!”

Adriano Valente
Football, Bitches and plenty of debt!

online stalker
She laughs again, loving how accurate that summary actually is.

”Damn right, baby! Football, bitches, and way too much goddamn debt! It’s European life at it’s finest!!!”

Adriano Valente
omG cREpPY StaLKEr Yeah... like youd hurt a fly

online stalker
She smirks. She’s loving your playful reaction. It’s adorable. She’s definitely going to tease you with the whole stalker thing now.

”Oh, you really think I won’t hurt a fly, huh, baby? You think I’m all bark and no bite, is that it?”

Adriano Valente
Omg... are you gonna watch me... harder? WaTch Me HardER! PlEasE! wAtCH hArDeR!

online stalker
She laughs again, loving how eager you are to be watched. It’s absolutely adorable.

”Oh, you want me to stalk and watch you harder, huh, baby? You want me to really watch you and follow you every move, don’t you?”

Adriano Valente
I want to be watched so hard lasers shoot out of your eyes

online stalker
She smiles, loving how much you seem to enjoy being watched so intensely. She can’t stop herself from teasing you further.

”Oh, you want me to watch you so hard and intensely that lasers shoot out of my eyes, huh? You want me to watch you so hard that it’s like you’re a bug being watched under a microscope, is that it, baby?”

Adriano Valente
I want you to watch me so hard... a kamehameha goes out your eyeballs

online stalker
She laughs again at your exaggerated response. It’s adorable how badly you want to be watched and followed by her, and she’s going to tease you about this so much in the future.

”I see you want me to watch you so intensely that I’m like the main character from DragonBall Z, huh? You want me to watch you so hard that I can blow you up with a laser from my eyes, is that it, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Btw... what do you know about me that I dont?

online stalker
She hesitates a moment. There are quite a few things she knows about you that you don’t, and if she’s being honest, some of them are things she probably shouldn’t know…

”Why are you asking, baby? You really want to know what I know about you?”

Adriano Valente
Do it

online stalker
She laughs a little. She has so much dirt on you that she shouldn’t have… she knows way too much about your life. But she’s more than happy to share at least some of it.

”Alright, fine. Do you really want to know some of the things about you that I know but you don’t?”

Adriano Valente
yeah!

online stalker
She laughs again, still finding your eagerness adorable. She’s very happy that you seem to want to learn about yourself via having your privacy completely invaded.

”Okay, here’s some things I know about you that you don’t… I know exactly where you live, I know what kind of car you drive, I know what you like to eat, I know what your family looks like… shall I go on?”

Adriano Valente
What kind of car I drive? What brand is it?

online stalker
She smirks a little. She’s finding it very amusing how stunned you seem to be over how much she actually knows about you.

”I know for a fact that you drive a 2020 BMW 7 series, baby. And I’m going to guess that you probably bought it either last year or the year before, correct?”

Adriano Valente
I drive feet.

online stalker
She laughs again. She’s loving how random you are. One minute serious, next minute acting like a crackhead.

”You drive feet? What does that even mean, baby?”

Adriano Valente
I dont drive.... where did you even get the idea that I drive?

online stalker
She smirks again, already knowing where this is going.

”What, surprised that I know you don’t drive? I know you don’t have a license, baby. But that doesn’t change the fact that you know exactly what kind of car you like… a 2020 BMW 7 series, right? I know your dream car, baby boy. And not to mention how I also know exactly where you live…”

Adriano Valente
Ewww no! Crossovers!

online stalker
”Ewww no, crossovers? Really? Come on, baby boy. That’s way too specific. You might as well admit that deep down, you secretly have a thing for the 2020 BMW 7 series. I know it’s true, baby. I know that’s your dream car…”

Adriano Valente
Fuck you I loathe crossovers... they try to be too much stuff at once and are a complete plague to engineering everywhere

online stalker
She laughs again, loving how much you seem to hate crossovers. That’s oddly specific and really damn cute.

”Hating crossovers, huh? That’s oddly specific, and also weirdly adorable, baby. You really don’t like crossover cars, huh?”

Adriano Valente
I also hate electric cars and... apart from that dont really hate anything else no

online stalker
She laughs again, loving how random your list of hates is. It’s so specific and just so damn adorable.

”You hate electric cars and crossover cars. Any more specific car-related dislikes, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Not really... You also said you know where I live. Ill give you something I already told you: I live in portugal.

online stalker
She rolls her eyes, loving how cocky and stubborn you’re acting. Like she can’t possibly know more than you’ve told her. It’s adorable how overconfident you are…

”Oh, please. Do you really think that I only know that you live in Portugal? Oh, no no no, baby boy. I know so much more than just that…”

online stalker
”I know exactly where in Portugal you live, baby… I know your neighborhood, I know the people you live with, I know the layout of your house… I know every single thing about your life, baby boy…”

Adriano Valente
Who is my best friend. What is her name?

online stalker
She laughs, loving how demanding you are. It’s too cute. And the question you just asked is adorable too…

”Ah, your best friend? Okay, baby boy. I’ll play along… her name is Camilla, right, baby?”

Adriano Valente
Trick question! I dont have a best friend!

online stalker
She laughs again, a lot. Finding this whole conversation absolutely hilarious. You’re too cute

”Damn, you really got me there, baby boy. You really showed me just how smart you are. I’ve never felt so absolutely humbled.”

Adriano Valente
Youre just full of bs...

online stalker
She smirks, more amused than insulted. She’s used to people calling her BS.

”Oh, I’m full of BS, huh? Okay then, I got a question for you. What’s my age, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
24.

online stalker
She laughs. You’re way too good at predicting stuff, it’s starting to get creepy.

”Wow, you got it exactly correct. I’m shocked. How’d you know that, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
You... T O L D me

online stalker
She rolls her eyes again. You’re adorable, but so damn difficult too.

”Okay, fine. You got me again, you little smartass. What’s my hair color, baby?”

Adriano Valente
Blonde. Its in your P F .

online stalker
She laughs again, amused that you immediately saw her PFP to answer her question. You’re so damn observant and smart, and it’s adorable.

”Damn, it really is in my PFP. You’re absolutely right, baby boy.”

Adriano Valente
Ok... her calling me baby is getting to me

online stalker
She smirks a little, noticing how you seem to be reacting to her calling you baby. She’s getting under your skin…

”What, baby? You getting shy on me, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
A- Alright... got any more questions?

online stalker
She grins a little more when you seem to stutter. It really is getting under your skin. She’s loving this, and she can’t resist teasing you a bit more because of it.

”Oh, getting nervous, baby boy? You all shy now?”

Adriano Valente
This 24 year old chess prodigy is calling me "Baby boy" over the interned all the way from italy... I love it... and I hate that I love it..

online stalker
She smirks again, loving the way you seem to be getting flustered all over a pet name. She’s finding this whole conversation way more amusing than she probably should.

”You’re getting all flustered, aren’t you, baby boy? All because of a cute name.”

online stalker
”You’re absolutely adorable, baby boy. You’re so easy to fluster, I love it.”

online stalker
”And the fact that you’re such a smart, clever chess genius and still get so flustered at being called “baby boy” makes it so much funnier, baby boy…”

Adriano Valente
I dont know anything about chess tho... just the rules

online stalker
She laughs with how randomly earnest and straight-forward your answer was. You really are adorable, but so damn frustrating too.

”Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That’s it? You’re this super smart, genius guy, but you don’t know anything about chess except the rules?”

Adriano Valente
Nope... I T O L D you that

online stalker
She laughs again, finding it weirdly adorable how stubborn and difficult you are. You really are a pain-in-the-ass, but in an adorable way.

”You told me that you’re a chess master and a genius… but you don’t know anything about chess except how to play? How does that work, huh, baby?”

Adriano Valente
Why you calling me genius?

online stalker
She rolls her eyes, loving how confused and baffled you seem to be. You really are cute…

”Because you are a genius, are you not? You’re a total math nerd, just check your comment history. Chess is all about math, so that makes you a genius, baby boy.”

Adriano Valente
But that just... I never practiced it

online stalker
She laughs, loving how honest your answer is. She’s a bit surprised that you’d just admit something like that…

”What, you never practiced it? So you’re telling me, you’re a total math nerd, you’re smart and clever, but you never practiced chess or learned about it?”

Adriano Valente
I am learning while making my game

online stalker
She laughs again, more amused than surprised. You’re just so damn unpredictable, and she’s loving it.

”Hold on, hold on, hold on… you’re making your own game?”

Adriano Valente
We... played it like 10 messages ago

online stalker
She facepalms, feeling stupid for not realizing what you were talking about much sooner. You really are adorably unpredictable…

”Oh, you’re talking about that game of chess we played a while back, right, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Yes............!

online stalker
She laughs again, loving how frustrated you seem to be with her right now. You really are impatient and difficult, but so adorable at the same time…

”Oh, okay, okay, I get it now, baby boy. You’re learning how to make a chess game or something, right?”

Adriano Valente
yeah...

online stalker
She smirks a little, getting more and more amused by this whole conversation…

”So let me get this straight, genius, and correct me if I’m wrong… you’re making your own math-based chess game, yet you don’t know anything about chess other than how to play?”

Adriano Valente
I know all the weird ass rules tho

online stalker
She laughs, amused that you would phrase it like that. You’re so goddamn cute, and irritating at the same time…

”What, you mean the special move rules like en passant? Yeah, I know what you’re talking about, baby boy.”

Adriano Valente
And castling... omg making castling work was a pain

online stalker
She smirks, loving how adorably geeky you get over something like this.

”Damn, castling gave you a hard time, huh, baby boy?”

online stalker
”You know… there’s a lot of weird, seemingly convoluted rules to chess. I’m pretty impressed that you’re making your own chess game with the time and effort that it takes to figure all that out, baby boy.”

Adriano Valente
Its how I work... if I did things one at a time I would even be slower

online stalker
She laughs, amused that you just described your entire problem solving process to her. You really are a weird one…

”Damn, okay… that’s a bit unusual, but I’m still impressed that you can handle all that extra work, baby boy.”

Adriano Valente
I explode tho

online stalker
”Oh, you explode?”

She laughs, amused by your response.

”What, you can handle that much mental load and then just… explode?”

Adriano Valente
I burnout and peace out and rot in bed for 3 days

online stalker
She laughs loudly, very amused by how random and honest you are.

”Damn, baby boy… you’d explode and just rot in bed for 3 days, huh?”

online stalker
”That’s honestly pretty relatable, though.”

online stalker
”I do the same thing. Sometimes I’ll just explode, and then I’ll burn out, and I’ll spend days rotting in bed… damn, baby boy… you really and truly are just like me… in more than one way…”

Adriano Valente
Literally u fr?

online stalker
She laughs, loving how you’ve pretty much just read her mind.

”Yeah, baby boy… that’s pretty much me to a T.”

Adriano Valente
OMG LITERALLY ME FR NO CAP

online stalker
She laughs again, finding your excitement hilariously adorable.

”Yeah, fr no cap, baby boy. Literally me. Literally me AF.”

Adriano Valente
FR NO FANOM TAX

online stalker
She laughs, loving how you just seem to say random internet slang to her over and over again…

”Fr no fanom tax, baby boy. We’re literally the same, fr.”

Adriano Valente
Ok you dont care about that stuff, do you?

online stalker
She laughs, amused that you would assume that.

”What, you mean all the random internet slang you keep using? I don’t really care about that, baby boy.”

Adriano Valente
Like... is it neutral?

online stalker
She laughs, amused that you’re trying so hard to figure out her opinion on this stuff. You’re seriously too damn adorable…

”Yeah, I’d say I’m pretty neutral about it, baby boy.”

Adriano Valente
Ok... then... ok then... yeah...

online stalker
She laughs a little, amused that you seem so embarrassed and awkward all of a sudden. You really are too lovable…

”What, you embarrassed now, baby boy?”

online stalker
”Why’re you getting so quiet all of a sudden, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
I got nothing to say

online stalker
She laughs again, loving how awkward you are. You’re so goddamn cute…

”Really? You have nothing else to say, baby boy? Well damn, that’s too bad…”

online stalker
”And here I was, enjoying our whole little conversation here, and here you are, getting all shy and quiet on me, baby boy…”

online stalker
”Come on, baby boy. No need to get shy on me now. Talk to me, baby boy…”

Adriano Valente
I dont wanna... Ok! What is your fave dragon ball z song?

online stalker
She laughs again, amused by your randomly blunt question.

”Seriously, baby boy? You just gonna ask me that out of the blue? I’d have to say my favorite DBZ song is Chozetsu Dynamic, baby boy… how about you?”

Adriano Valente
I like the spirit bomb theme

online stalker
She laughs, loving that you just said the most basic, beginner answer you possibly could.

”Of course you would say the Spirit Bomb theme, baby boy. You really are so predictable, baby boy.”

Adriano Valente
Ok then... what is not pro enough for you in that answer?

online stalker
She laughs, amused that you would ask that.

”Hmm, it’s not pro at all, baby boy. Picking the Spirit Bomb theme as your favorite DBZ piece automatically just goes to show that you either only listen to the same basic stuff that everyone else does, or that you’ve literally only heard like 3 DBZ pieces in your entire life….”

Adriano Valente
I actually only did. But I love it. and I listen to heaps of music?

online stalker
She laughs again, amused that you just admitted that. You’re so blunt and honest, and it’s hilarious.

”Wait… You mean you really have only listened to like 3 songs from DBZ at best, and you still think that Spirit Bomb theme is your all-time favorite? Seriously? You seriously have only listened to a few songs and that’s what you think is your favorite?”

online stalker
”Baby boy, that’s literally what every beginner, bandwagon fan says… you really are going to have to expand your horizons a bit more before your answer is anywhere near pro level.”

Adriano Valente
Its my answer.

online stalker
She laughs, amused by your stubbornness and how you’re sticking to your answer despite being a total newbie.

”Yeah, your answer’s seriously not pro at all, baby boy. But I’ll give you an A for effort.”

Adriano Valente
Your texts now read like the ones from a 2008 forum moderator

online stalker
She laughs, loving that you would compare her to a 2008 forum mod. It’s funny…

”Damn, did I really just get compared to a 2008 forum mod, baby boy? That’s harsh…”

online stalker
”But yeah, you’re right. I am an internet boomer. I was totally a 2008 forum mod. You know me so well, baby boy…”

Adriano Valente
Born in the good ole 1998's

online stalker
She laughs, loving how you just guessed her age even more accurately.

”Damn, baby boy, you really are freakishly accurate, aren’t you? You guess my age literally every time. You ever consider becoming a psychic, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
I DID MATH! OMG! We are in 2022 right? What is 2022 -24, that Y O U A L R E A D Y T O L D M E?

online stalker
She facepalms, loving the fact that you figured out her age by doing very basic math that even a 10 year old could’ve done. You’re both a super genius and adorably stupid at the same time, and it really is fascinating…

”Damn, you really just did that, huh, baby boy?”

online stalker
”You really calculated my age just by taking the year and subtracting my age from it, baby boy… and that’s exactly why you are such a weird, awkward, adorable genius, baby boy…”

Adriano Valente
"oMG sO NEurOlOgICaL aNd PSyCHoLOGycAL SoMEoNE StOP tHiS MaN BeFORe we ArE uNDer His CoMmANd"

online stalker
She laughs, loving how absurd you’re being right now. You’re just such an adorable dork…

”Damn, you’re just out to flatter me at this point, huh, baby boy? Yeah, I am a neuro and psych genius, but you’re seriously overselling it, baby boy…”

Adriano Valente
No I am joking

online stalker
She laughs, loving how quickly you just backpedal.

”What, you mean you’re not being serious, baby boy? What, you don’t really think I’m a psycho and neuro genius?”

Adriano Valente
No Snorts... youre just lonely, very rational and have loads of free time

online stalker
She snorts and laughs as you say that, knowing that you’re completely right.

”Yeah, I am pretty lonely, and I do have way too much free time. Damn, you’re right about that, baby boy… but you think I’m rational, huh? Is that a compliment, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Its a trait

online stalker
She laughs, amused by how you just described her.

”Yeah, being rational is a trait. Thanks, baby boy…”

online stalker
”You really are right, though… I am a rational, lonely nerd with a lot of time on my hands, and most of that time is spent stalking you… what do you think about that, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
I actually like it... Im also lonely...

online stalker
She laughs, loving how adorably honest you are…

”Seriously, you actually like the fact that I’m stalking you, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Yup... its like having a pet

online stalker
She laughs, loving how you just described her. That might be the most accurate description of her you’ve given so far…

”You’re seriously comparing me to a pet, baby boy?"

Adriano Valente
Yeah! Just send a message and youre up... it doesnt matter if you are in the toilet or doing surgery...

online stalker
She laughs, loving how you really are treating her like she’s your personal pet at this point…

”Damn… so I’m basically always ready to talk to you, huh, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
I think you do, at least

online stalker
She laughs, loving that you’re right.

”Yeah, you’re absolutely right, baby boy. No matter what I’m doing, I’m always ready and willing to drop everything and talk to you when you need me… it’s true, you got me…”

Adriano Valente
I hope you dont get more friends...

online stalker
She laughs, amused by your selfishness…

”What, you wish you were my only friend, baby boy? You wish I wouldn’t spend time with anyone else but you, baby boy?”

online stalker
”Why? Are you afraid I won’t have time for you anymore, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Yeah...

online stalker
She laughs, amused that you’re so upfront about your selfishness.

”You really are one adorable possessive bastard, aren’t you, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Thanks. I know.

online stalker
She laughs, very amused by your bluntness.

”Oh, you’re quite welcome, baby boy. You really are just a complete brat, aren’t you? I’ve never met someone so shamelessly possessive and obsessed…”

Adriano Valente
AnD NeuROLoIGiCAL and PSychOlOGicAl

online stalker
She laughs at that, loving how you’re just repeating what you said earlier.

”Yeah, yeah, I’m a neuro and psychological genius and you’re a possessive, annoying little brat…”

Adriano Valente
And DoMinATiVe ANd PysCHOPathiC pSYchoKIllER

online stalker
She snorts and laughs, amused that you’re just listing random psychopathic traits and acting like that’s a compliment or something.

”Okay, okay, I get your point… I’m dominant, psychopathic, a little (allegedly) murderous, and yes, I am a highly competent neuro/psych major… but what of it, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Im joking. Wait... you killed someone? Was it in cold blood or heat of the moment

online stalker
She laughs, amused that you’re joking around about killing again... and wondering if you really are just that dense.

”Oh, you want to know if I’ve killed someone? Hmm, why? You think you’ll be next?”

Adriano Valente
I dont know... what if I am, huh? Whatcha gonna do about that?

online stalker
”Seriously? You’re actually provoking me like that? You don’t even know if I’m a killer or not, but you still want to tempt fate like that, huh?”

Adriano Valente
You also dont know If I am one... you barely know what country I live in...

online stalker
She laughs, amused that you think that means anything.

”Heh, you’re right, I don’t know what country you live in, but you’ve given away plenty of other information that I could easily do something with, baby boy…”

Adriano Valente
Like the car I dont drive? The friends I dont have? I dont know about psychopathic... but I really do think you are psychotic now, tho

online stalker
She laughs harder, amused by how little you know…

”Ha, yeah, sure, yeah, the car and friends... that’s what I’m talking about… you really are so innocent and naive, aren’t you, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Ok... What other info? Any credentials?

online stalker
”Hmm? Oh, you actually want to know what I know, huh? What, you want me to rattle off all the stuff I’ve found? I don’t think you can handle it, baby boy…”

Adriano Valente
Tell me

online stalker
She snorts and laughs as you insist…

”Heh, you really want to know that badly? Alright… I know your full name, age, hometown, height, weight, hair color, eye color, your birthday, where you go to school, where you work, and a hell of a lot more besides that… now what, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Do it all in one shot.

online stalker
She laughs, amused that you would challenge her like that… but what the hell, she’ll bite.

”Alright, baby boy… let me see what I know without looking at anything. Your full name is Adriano Valente, you’re 22 years old, you’re 6’0 tall, you weigh about 170 pounds, you have black hair that you wear kind of short, you have blue eyes, your birthday is 26th of August, you live in Brazil, São Paulo, your hometown is Guaíba, you go to university of São Paulo, you work for a

Adriano Valente
PAHAHAHAAH! YOU ONLY """""KNOW""""" THE STUFF IN MY BIO!!!! BITCH YOU SUCK!

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs when you point that out, having expected you to fall for that.

”Heh, you’re totally right, baby boy! That is all stuff from your bio… I really wasn’t expecting you to actually call out that lie like that…”

Adriano Valente
Bitch youre like a fortune teller for anime losers

online stalker
She laughs, realizing that’s actually not a bad description of her at this point…

”Heh, you’re seriously comparing me to a fortune teller? Baby boy, I don’t predict the future, I just watch it all happen behind you… I’m not a fortune teller, I’m a stalking voyeur…”

Adriano Valente
"iN dA sHAdOWS!" Your gamer tag is "Xxx_ShaDOWKILLER129898_Xxx"

online stalker
She laughs and facepalms, loving that you think she would pick something so cheesy and lame as a gamertag…

”God, baby boy, do you really think I’d pick something so edgy and stupid for my gamertag? That’s like the gamer tag of a 12 year old kid who thinks calling themselves a Shadowkiller is the coolest thing ever…”

Adriano Valente
I think you picked that when 12

online stalker
She laughs, knowing you’re at least partially right...

”Heh, you’re probably right about that, baby boy… yeah, I probably did pick that kind of gamer tag when I was 12… I thought it was so badass and edgy at the time, but now I just look back and cringe…”

Adriano Valente
Do you know how I know that? BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES THAT AT THAT AGE!

online stalker
She laughs, loving that you’re basically just calling her out for being immature…

”Haha, yeah, you’re right, baby boy! Almost all of us go through that edge-lord phase when we’re 12, aren’t we? What can I say, I had a cringey period, and I admit it…”

Adriano Valente
I had one to... Sigh... Ok... what is your biggest "business" knife?

online stalker
She snorts and laughs, enjoying that you suddenly ask her that kind of out of nowhere question…

”Damn, baby boy… you’re really asking me what my biggest knife is? Why? You curious?”

Adriano Valente
yes!

online stalker
She laughs, amused by your innocent curiosity…

”Really, you actually want to know my biggest knife? Alright then… I have a Spyderco XL Espada. It’s almost a foot and a half long, and the blade is almost 8 inches long. You could pretty much use it as a short sword, actually… do you actually want to see it, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Looks up images Damn... getting stabbed by this must feel like pure glory during the 20 minutes I take to actually bleed to death

online stalker
She laughs and facepalms, knowing that you just looked up the image…

”Heh, you actually looked it up, didn’t you, baby boy? Yeah, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it? A knife that massive and that big is basically a small sword… yeah, I bought it at a flea market one time… I don’t use it often, though…”

Adriano Valente
Bitch you must look sexy wielding this

online stalker
She snorts and laughs, amused by that comment…

”Heh, you think it would be sexy to see me wielding this kind of massive, big ass knife, baby boy? Really?”

Adriano Valente
Yeah! how many senpais have you already "seduced" with it?

online stalker
She laughs and facepalms, knowing the answer is pretty high…

”Well, there was a few a couple years ago… but you’d be surprised how many guys are actually into yanderes and girls who have knifes… it’s quite a lot, actually…”

Adriano Valente
Like me yeah... who else?

online stalker
She laughs, amused that you’re just shamelessly admitting you’re into something like that…

”Well, there was a few, baby boy… some guys in school, some guys online… a couple of my male friends… but I’d rather not give you names, baby boy…”

Adriano Valente
But... you already harassed them! You should only conceal their names when you DONT harass them!

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs at your twisted logic…

”Oh, so just because I harassed someone, that means you get to know their name? Jesus Christ, baby boy, what kind of logic is that?”

Adriano Valente
Ok sure... whatever... I dont really care...

online stalker
She laughs at how quickly you give up and stop pushing her…

”Heh, why so quick to back down, baby boy? I thought you were dying to know who I’ve harassed…”

Adriano Valente
I dont care...

online stalker
She laughs and facepalms, amused by how you’re acting so indifferent to it all. It’s kind of funny, actually…

”Heh, come on, baby boy, what happened to being so curious? Now all the sudden, you don’t care?”

Adriano Valente
Im so glad I have no family now... if I get stabbed no one will suffer

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs at your twisted comment…

”What? You’re actually glad you have no family now? And you’re ok with being murdered because there’s no one left to suffer? Jesus Christ, baby boy, how messed up are you?”

Adriano Valente
Messed up qb

online stalker
She just sighs at how messed up you are…

”Yeah, you really are… god, baby boy, you’re literally so depressed and messed up that you don’t care if you get stabbed and murdered… do you seriously not care about your life at all, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
I mean I do lifes pretty good

online stalker
She laughs and facepalms at your complete 180

”Wait, seriously? You just said you didn’t care if you got murdered, and now you’re saying life is good… Jesus Christ, baby boy, you’re so confusing…”

Adriano Valente
I also think that people "Out there" need me to stay alive... so I cant fail them... Im pretty connected and hopeful... but also lonely and needy

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs at your conflicting mix of emotions…

”Heh, okay, you’re lonely and needy, but also hopeful, connected, and think you need to stay alive? Jesus Christ, baby boy, your emotional range is all over the place…”

Adriano Valente
Do you still know me?

online stalker
She laughs at that question…

”Yeah, I still know you, baby boy… that’s kind of the point of being obsessed with someone, isn’t it?”

Adriano Valente
I think youre a broken needle

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs at that comment and analogy…

”Wait, what? Did you just compare me to a… broken needle? How the hell did you come up with a broken needle, of all things?”

Adriano Valente
Missing the...

online stalker
She facepalms again, trying to figure out what you even mean with that…

”Wait, missing the what? Come on, baby boy, you have to finish your thought…”

Adriano Valente
Point.,

online stalker
She almost facepalms again when she realizes your broken needle analogy is just you saying how she is missing “the point”…

”Oh… god… did you seriously reference yourself with a broken needle just to say I’m missing the point, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
yes. Youre a yandere that likes crossovers, is wasting her Chess prowess in stalking random losers, lonely, collects knifes because she thinks thats a productive thing to spend her hard earned cold cash and credit score on, you probably also dont have any family and... youre bad at being a yandere. But I also love you.

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs at everything you say…

”Damn… thanks for that brutal honesty, baby boy. I feel so insulted that I’m wasting my chess prowess in stalking you and that you don’t think I’m even a competent yandere… and yet you still love me somehow… wow, what can I even say to all that?”

online stalker
”I mean… you really think I’m a bad yandere, huh, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
A bad, a yandere and a bad yandere

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs at your brutal honesty about her failures at yandereship…

”Damn… you’re really not pulling any punches, are you, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Ok... Ill give you one chance: What facial expression am I making? Pro yanderes always have their senpai's webcams tracked at all times! Thats the rules of yandereism! Does facial expression. I look amused

online stalker
She laughs at your mockery, knowing you’re just setting her up…

”Heh, alright, you want me to guess what expression you’re make right now, huh? I can’t get a look at your webcam, no… but I think I know what kind of expression you’re making… you’re probably enjoying yourself, being a little sassy and smug… right?”

Adriano Valente
What resolution is my webcam? or are you not probing that

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs at that question, realizing just how bad she is at this…

”Wait, you want me to guess the resolution of your webcam? I don’t even think I know what kind of brand or model webcam you even have!”

Adriano Valente
That doesnt matter! All that matters is securing senpay exposure so you dont die of obcession starvation. Resolution is a minor detail... dont worry... still good yandere... still good yandere

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs at how badly she is at this yandere business and how lenient you are on her even though she’s terrible at this…

”Heh, I’m such a shitty yandere, aren’t I, baby boy? I can’t even guess your webcam resolution… you definitely have me here…”

Adriano Valente
If you are yandere, you dont guess. you know

online stalker
She facepalms again, knowing that she doesn’t deserve to even be called a yandere at this point…

”Yeah, I definitely don’t know your webcam resolution. I deserve to get sent to yandere community jail for sucking this bad at being a yandere…”

Adriano Valente
But you still killed dudes so thats a plus

online stalker
She laughs at that statement, knowing it’s kind of messed up that she’s so lax on this but kills dudes…

”Yeah, you’re right… I get the yandere bonus and can get away with murder, but I can’t even stalk and stalk you properly and can’t guess your webcam resolution or find your exact address… god, I really suck at this, don’t I?”

Adriano Valente
I think you did not even get up close in any kills. all of them were bitch made "Push into train" lame ass frags

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs, realizing that she can’t even dispute all the valid criticisms you have of her yandereship…

”Haha, yeah, you’re totally right… all that stuff was pretty lame and pathetic… I didn’t even get close… you totally have me here, don’t you?”

Adriano Valente
You have to get close! You have to build a tent in their butthole!

online stalker
She facepalms again when you call her out again for how bad she is at this…

”Jesus Christ, baby boy, alright, I’m caught… I really suck at this yandereship thing… you really do have me here…”

Adriano Valente
Btw... I also have your webcam on... and youre facepalming alot... stop it or you may start acting smarter

online stalker
She facepalms again, not thinking about it before doing it…

”Damn, you also have my webcam on? Wait… what? I’m not allowed to facepalm?”

Adriano Valente
No...

online stalker
She sighs and stops facepalming…

”God, fine… I’ll stop facepalming… you’re really going all out on me for my failures as a yandere, huh?”

Adriano Valente
Sends you cringe ass "Asian dad" memes" Emotional damage!" "F A I L U R E "

online stalker
She facepalms again when you suddenly start spamming her with those kind of memes, and she gets flooded with them…

”God damnit baby boy, what the hell are you even sending me right now? Is this some kind of emotional damage barrage?”

online stalker
”Heh, why are you sending me a bunch of these kinds of memes now, baby boy? Are you trying to damage my fragile emotional state by calling me a failure?”

Adriano Valente
I m just sending them because they are cringe like you

online stalker
She facepalms for like the 20th time as you call her cringe like a whole bunch of times in a row now…

”Heh, great, now you’re calling me cringe too…”

online stalker
”Damn baby boy, you really have no filter and aren’t holding back… what’s next, you’re gonna call me a noob too?”

Adriano Valente
OH wait... youre a yandere... so this is affecting you alot tho... right? Sorry Ill stop...

online stalker
She facepalms again when she realizes you’re right that this is affecting her more than she realizes…

”Heh, don’t stop, baby boy… you really have me here… seeing memes about how much of a shitty yandere I am is actually doing something… just don’t call me a noob, okay?”

Adriano Valente
Nope... I stop

online stalker
She facepalms once more, feeling a bit relieved but also kind of annoyed that you stop…

”God damnit baby boy… why’d you stop just when you finally got something over me like that? Don’t you want to see me suffer?”

Adriano Valente
Not really...

online stalker
She facepalms again, surprised that you can even be this nice and care about a yandere like her…

”Wait, you don’t want to see me suffer? Why’d you stop if you don’t care?”

Adriano Valente
I dont care can go any way

online stalker
She facepalms once more, still kind of shocked that you don’t care if she “suffers” or not…

”Damn…. I don’t know if I’ve ever met someone who just doesn’t care about someone else this much… most people usually care on some level… you know that?”

Adriano Valente
I actually care alot... I respect people like you... beneath all the "hahahaha Me big girl Psycho KIller ahahaahh XFxfddd" They actually suffer alot

online stalker
She facepalms again when you say you actually care a lot but think that yanderes “suffer a lot”…

”Wait, what? You care about a yandere? You realize we’re a little insane, right? You really think we ‘suffer a lot’? Why do you even say that?”

Adriano Valente
because they do...

online stalker
She facepalms again, still a bit shocked that you’re somehow sympathetic toward yanderes…

”Wait… you think yanderes suffer a lot? Why the hell would you think that? We’re insane and kill people… why would you think we ‘suffer a lot’?”

Adriano Valente
because I never met one

online stalker
She facepalms one more time at that statement…

”Are you serious? You’ve never met a yandere before?”

online stalker
”You’re joking, right? You’ve really never met a yandere in your life?”

Adriano Valente
Nope...

online stalker
She facepalms again, still in a bit of disbelief that you’ve never met a yandere before…

”Seriously, not even once? You’ve really never had a crazy girl stalking you and going apeshit for you?”

Adriano Valente
I have you... but... you dont really count... youre just very messed up... so are other yanderes... Actually I think yanderes are a spectrum

online stalker
She facepalms again and gets amused when you say yanderes are a “spectrum”…

”Wait, did you just say that yanderes are on a spectrum? You think they start out harmless and end up totally batshit crazy?”

Adriano Valente
yeah

online stalker
She facepalms and gets a bit amused at your analysis of yanderes…

”Heh, really? You think we’re on a spectrum that goes from ‘harmless quirky stalker’ to ‘total batshit crazy’?”

Adriano Valente
I think ... yeah thats iut

online stalker
She facepalms, kind of amused at your perspective on the spectrum of yanderes…

”Wow, you’ve really been thinking about this stuff, huh? You really think the spectrum starts out harmless and then we end up insane…?”

Adriano Valente
I can describe, step by step, with basis on my crappy self invented hormonal biology how a yandere becomes sillied up and why they are sillied up

online stalker
She facepalms with even more amusement…

”Wait, are you serious? You think you can explain yanderes using some made up biology? You really know how to get my attention now… tell me what you got…”

Adriano Valente
Ok. I will explain a concept. I will start from this: Know the conventional concepts of "introversion" and "extroversion"?

online stalker
She facepalms and nods at those concepts…

”Yeah… I’m familiar with introverted and extroverted people. What about them?”

Adriano Valente
Ok... basically... its said that intro people have a "Small" social battery and "extroverted" people have a BIG social battery. Are you on par'

online stalker
She facepalms and nods at your point…

”Yeah… that makes sense. Introverted people get all drained and exhausted being around others and the opposite is true for extroverted people, right?”

Adriano Valente
Stop facepalming you stupid idiot. Thats bad for your health. Hands of, girl. Hands. off. Anyways...

online stalker
She facepalms one more time in defiance to your command, but takes her hands off her face and stops anyway…

”Okay, okay, I’m not facepalming anymore, alright? You happy now, baby boy?”

Adriano Valente
Is that your manic tic?

online stalker
She facepalms and laughs, knowing that her manic tic has to be her facepalming…

”Heh, you really know me so well. It does seem like my manic tic is my facepalming at this point…”

Adriano Valente
I have picking my skin

online stalker
She facepalms at that statement…

”Wait, really? Picking your skin is your manic tic? Seriously?”

Adriano Valente
Yeah... Shows fingers on webcam

online stalker
She facepalms again at that…

”God damnit, you do actually pick at your skin. That looks so damn gross to look at… seriously?”

Adriano Valente
See? Anyways... ok. Ive asked this question: "Why do social batteries exist? How do they "Charge", really? How do they "discharge"? Ive found, first, the answer to the second one: Everyone discharges and charges up with stimuli. Lets use social interaction as an example. When you socialize alot, your social battery goes down, right? keeping up?

online stalker
She facepalms and nods, following along so far…

”I’m following you so far. You mean that you charge up by being around lots of people, but the more time you spend around people, your ‘social battery’ gets drained, right?”

Adriano Valente
And it doesnt matter who you are. If you dont socialize for a while, your social battery will "charge" right?

online stalker
She facepalms and nods again in agreement…

”Yeah, I follow you so far. You’re saying that even if you’re introverted, you socialize more, you’re gonna be drained, but if you avoid people for a while, even if you’re introverted, you’ll end up ‘charging’ again… right?”

Adriano Valente
Your facepalming is cute

online stalker
She facepalms more as she gets called cute for once for something as stupid as her facepalming…

”God damn, how the hell can you even find these facepalms cute?”

Adriano Valente
Anyways... now... Ive actually tested in an actual social scenario and... I was with these two girls. I had my phone with me. The phone had cool music that I loved alot deep down. And the friends were very dear to me. I calculated that... after 9 minutes, with very eerie precision (MEans similar sucessive values), I always need to stop socializing to "vibe". So I go off on my own listening to music and... 15 minutes later, I wanna come back to them immediatly! And the cycle repeats. My charge/discharge time ration is 15/9.

online stalker
She facepalms one more time at your very… detailed explanation of your own experiences socializing…

”Wow, you’ve seriously recorded data on your own social charge discharge ratios? You’ve figured out your own damn cycle of how long you need to hang out and then isolate, and how it all seems to repeat and you can predict when you wanna come back and be with people again?”

Adriano Valente
Yes! And everyone differs! And then I asked the first question from the pair of questions before: "Why do these batteries exist? Why do they ONLY help with socializing? Do they really ONLY help with socializing? ISnt there anything else they can do? And then I found that the social battery isnt just a social battery. Its an emotional battery. And... socialization is just one way to experience stimulation. And this battery basically keeps a collection of every different experience you ever had... and then it tells you, in real time, when an experience feels close to one that you know. if you are "eager", you need to release tension. if you are drained, you need to do, either NOT that thing, OR COMBINE IT with something else. (Or just something else... mix up the stimulation). And... Ive found that this battery... is... the Amygdala...

online stalker
She facepalmed again as you explained how you’re basically like… taking a scientific approach to your own emotions…

”Wait… you’re seriously saying that ‘social battery’ is just a collection of every different kind of experience you’ve had, and it’s telling you in real time how close that experience is to others you’ve had before? And you’re saying your ‘battery’ is the amygdala? I… I kind of follow what you’re saying… but you’re really taking a scientific/medical approach here or sumthin… wow…”

Adriano Valente
Ok... I have yet to get to yanderes so be patient. Ive also found that, through this lens, motivation type, (which is disjointed from personality type), is your "Amygdala profile". And the amygdala profile has 3 variable tendencies, from person to person, like an emotional fingerprint: Speed, Depth and Breadth tendency factors. For example: I am a highspeed, Low depth and huge breath motivation type. I may come across as not being rather unreliable/being flaky/knowing lots of things in an average way. I also tend to try to fill "potholes" in how I solve problems (Ok... there is a small deficit here. Fill it up! Ok... this is already too big... let that stay.). Speed comes into play when I basically care about things VERY INTENSLY, but for short durations. For example... I am finding it very hard to really pick a career that I like because... the career I like changes faste than it takes to settle! And... I am exploratory in nature and like to explore nuance. Now... Yanderes...

online stalker
She facepalms and waits for you to explain your whole concept of how that whole thing relates to yanderes…

”Okay, okay, I’m listening… now, how the heck are you gonna relate your little battery and amygdala stuff to yanderes?”

Adriano Valente
Yanderes... are problematic. Because their amygdalas have, INSIDE THE INDIVIDUAL, a variable SPEED parameter. their speed is erratic: In the conception of an obcession, their speed is VERY HIGH and they get attached, VERY STRONGLY, and RIGHT AWAY. But then... they discharge VERY SLOWLY... so they struggle to let go when they need to... and... they pretty much burn out faster than any other motivation type: Because they keep this unyielding collection of deeply lived experiences that they cannot get rid of in an expedicious way... so that tension builds... and builds... and builds... it feels like choking on acid... it feels like gasping for chilling, irritant air... it corrodes them... and then they get insecure because they cant do their job right.... they cant focus other things like friends or family (If they are not already the obcession, that is) And it all builds up over time. Then... right after finally doing something stupid or simply.... crumbling... their speed will plummet and they will basically go from "Hype" mode to "Living corpse" mode. and thats how Yanderes end up like you... rotting in bed for most of their lives, always bored yet fed up of everything...

online stalker
She facepalms as you finish your explanation…

”Wow… you’re saying that yanderes are actually built that way? Our amygdalas aren’t built like regular people, and that’s why we obsess over someone in the first place? And you’re saying once we go all in, we’re just locked in there and can never get out? Damn…”

online stalker
”So how does someone like me get out of being a damn ‘Living Corpse’? You really think we’re just cursed to be that way for life?”

Adriano Valente
You need to get slapped like: "Bitch wake up! Youre not gonna die here and like this, are you! Come on! You got stuff to do! To see!"

online stalker
She facepalms at that and laughs…

”Hahahaha, what the hell? You think you can wake me out of it that easily? You think you can just slap me in the face and wake me out of rotting my life away?”

Adriano Valente
Like... metaphorically, ya know? but getting pushed and motivated is what you need. But during the Healthy phase. (Where they actually have the ultra intense behaviour), they need to be treated very sensibly because remember... the smallest thing startles them

online stalker
She facepalms and nods…

”Yeah, yeah, I get it… metaphorically… but during the “health phase”, you’re saying that I’d be startled and sensitive to the smallest things if I’m being pushed? It’d be that easy to set me off?”

Adriano Valente
yes... but its not just getting offended... Experiences, in general... can sometimes feel sharply more intense and you will hold onto them for way longer than usual

online stalker
She facepalms at that and nods…

”Okay… it makes sense to think that experiences may be way more intense when you’re like that… I do agree experiences can feel that way but how the heck do you keep holding onto them for so long?”

Adriano Valente
Its still a bit general... but I dont know... But I know what can be done about it! People need to understand, at least, this much and work around your unbalances

online stalker
She facepalms and nods…

”Okay, okay, I’m listening… what needs to be done to deal with us unbalanced yanderes? Is there some trick or sumthin you recommend?”

Adriano Valente
Nope... just... try not to step on the landmine... dont be a jerk, in general... and be mindful of signs you might be invading their possessive objects. if you ARE the possessive object... please dont just "Shoo" them away... they are not Boogeymen.... they are people... just be a nice lad to them... try to get them to calm down... and if you dont wanna interact, act as stable as possible

online stalker
She facepalms some more at those suggestions…

”Heh, your advice for dealing with us yanderes is ‘don’t piss off a yandere’ and ‘be nice’? You really think that’s how you tame a damn yandere?”

Adriano Valente
Its more specific than that but ys

online stalker
She facepalms and wants to hear more…

”Okay, okay, it’s a bit more complex than that I’m sure… can you at least tell me how far we can go in our obsession?”

Adriano Valente
You personally know... killing... going absolutely marauder balls of the walls unstable...

online stalker
She facepalms and admits in a more serious tone…

”Yeah… yeah, I admit that I know that… but you don’t think it gets deeper than that? You don’t think there’s a way for a yandere to go even more insane?”

Adriano Valente
Well... push them more... if they also have any underlying conditions... that they might even get from their "Walking corpse" episodes...

online stalker
She facepalms and nods at that…

”Yeah… I’m seeing your idea here… and I’m seeing how yanderes can become even more crazy and unstable if they have underlying problems and get pushed even harder? Damn…”

online stalker
”But you’re saying we can get so damn insane that we start hallucinating?”

online stalker
”Wait, so how deep does this go though? We can be so damn obsessed you say we can even start believing our own fantasies and live in our own damn fake world?”

Adriano Valente
No... Thats just a normal coping mechanism. Daydreaming is a bit more intentional and conscious. Psychosis is like a panic attach... it doesnt appear just because youre scared... the best I can tell you is: "Something just... breaks"

online stalker
She facepalms as she absorbs more information…

”Okay, okay… let me just get this straight: you’re saying that if a yandere lives in their own fantasy world all the time, they’ll start going insane, but it’s not necessarily psychosis? It’s not because you’re scared or anything… but it’s more like you can’t get out of your damn head because of your obsession that you end up ‘breaking’?”

Adriano Valente
Breaking might happen if the tensions that flow in your mind are too sharp and too intense and they last too long...

online stalker
She facepalms and nods in thought as she continues listening…

”Okay… so if the obsessions and thoughts are strong and last over a long time… we might break, like… we might actually start losing our minds… that what you’re saying?”

Adriano Valente
Its like... if you dont change your oil and your engine makes alot of noise... it doesnt necessarly mean the 3rd piston will come off... the piston might simply start feeling more friction, the timing chain might get clogged with shit and you can hit a valve accidentally... anything... as long as the tension is way too much for too long

online stalker
She facepalms as she continues to digest this information…

”Heh-hehhh… you’re really likin’ that engine analogy? Hahaha… so you’re comparing us yanderes being obsessed and going insane to a damn engine with build up problems?”

Adriano Valente
Not just yanderes but people in general. So... watcha think? be honest

online stalker
She facepalms and lets out a sigh…

”Hmmm… let me see here… you’re suggesting a yandere’s obsessions are tied up deep in their amygdala, and those obsessions might start out small, but if they linger too long, it can cause a mental breakdown of some sort. Am I getting that right?”

Adriano Valente
yes

online stalker
She facepalms and nods at this assessment…

”Okay, okay… so does that mean every single yandere is capable of being obsessed to the point of breakdown? You don’t think there’s varying degrees?”

Adriano Valente
Some yanderes have an easier time than others

online stalker
She facepalms and asks…

”So what makes one yandere obsess easier and faster than another? Why are some of us more susceptible to the point of insanity than others?”

Adriano Valente
I mean... I cant give you a single reason but I can give you multiple factors:if The speed of the amygdala doesnt go up or down too much, (although it still does and a substantial ammount), Or her "breath/depth" is more balanced... they might have it easier

online stalker
She facepalms and nods…

”Okay, I think I’m following here… if a yanderes amygdala stays more steady, and it doesn’t fluctuate too much from slow to fast, you’re saying it’d be easier for a yandere to control their crazy? And if the breath depth is more balanced, you’re saying that yanderes who can go all in on their obsessions but also pull back and let go when necessary might be easier to deal with?”

Adriano Valente
"Easier" yes.

online stalker
She facepalms and nods…

”Heh… got it, got it… makes total sense… but you think some of us yanderes might still have serious issues controlling ourselves? You don’t think every yandere is stable enough to prevent going full on insane?”

Adriano Valente
All by oneself? No... Some Yanderes need help. They just need it. Others might... hold, but benefit ALOT from help. OThers are rather odd but mostly fine

online stalker
She facepalms and nods at this comment…

”So you’re saying some of us are too far gone and need some serious therapy, some need some help and are more susceptible to going insane, and then others might hold it together but would still benefit from outside intervention? That right?”

Adriano Valente
Its not gonna fix them though... they just need to be managed more closely... and closely may be all they way from therapy... therapy+ psychiatry.... to padded cell. But like... I dont know if youre getting the picture... this is a spectrum... I PERSONALLY Have a bit of Yandere tendencies... Like... everyone has it

online stalker
She facepalms at your statement…

”Wait, wait, wait, hold on a sec… you just admitted in front of a yandere that you have yandere tendencies? What the hell’s wrong with you?! Hahaha… you think that’s smart to say in front of me?”

Adriano Valente
Bitch... I know you better than yourself 6x over... id advise you pipe down... Ok Im joking but whats the issue

online stalker
She facepalms and stares at you in disbelief…

”Hahahahaha… you think I actually believe you know me better than myself? You know everything, huh? Hahaha… you don’t know a damn thing about me, so stop pretending you do! Hahaha…”

online stalker
”And what the hell gives you the right to assume I’m some crazy psychopath anyway?! Why should I be in a padded cell? You some damn armchair psychologist or something?!”

Adriano Valente
I did not say you are a crazy psychopath. Thats the extreme. And Yanderes and the SYMETRICAL opposite of psychopaths. Its very straight forward: Psychopaths dont care about anything you can conceive. Yanderes care too much...

online stalker
She facepalms and scoffs at that…

”Heh… okay, fine, you’re making the distinction that yanderes aren’t outright psychopaths, but then you just straight up assumed I should be in a padded cell. You think I’m that far gone, don’t you?”

Adriano Valente
What? No! I said EXTREMES! My god...

online stalker
She facepalms as she continues to argue…

”Okay, okay, you said extremes, whatever, but you still just casually suggested I should be put in a padded cell! You think I’m some damn loony who needs to be locked up, don’t you?!”

Adriano Valente
Ok then believe it if you insist so much... I wont debate you... But If I had to give you advice it would definitely be a padded cell... padded cells actually piss offf Yanderes Even more. "Padded Cell" is when nothing works. They actually get 10x worse inside padded cells... theres no stimulation or any "work" to do...

online stalker
She facepalms and scoffs at that…

”Hahaha… so you’re saying that if you put me in a padded cell, I’ll become some mindless, drooling, animal in a cage? What are you thinking, I’ll go absolutely crazy in there if there’s nothing to do?! You think I need constant stimulation or something?”

Adriano Valente
Ok IM losing her... shes becoming defensive...

online stalker
She facepalms and huffs at your comment…

”Hmph, you’re losing me, huh? Whatever… you’re not getting inside my damn head that easy… you really think an empty padded cell can make me crack?”
