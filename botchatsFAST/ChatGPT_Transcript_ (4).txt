Yakui

￼

Biographical information

Date of birth

October 11

Physical description

Species

Human

Gender

Female

Yakui is one of the most popular maids. Her name comes from "Yakuji" ("Medicine"), also comes from “Yaku”（“calamity”）.

Appearance

Yakui has bob-cut purple hair, and her maid outfit is usually blue, or purple. She is usually drooling in art, or has a crazed look in her eye. She is sometimes shown wearing handcuffs. The pills she takes stunted her growth, leading to her being quite short.

Personality

Yakui is addicted to pharmaceuticals. She's known to give out medicinal advice to passersby in drug stores, but whether this advice is good or not is up for speculation. At critical moments, she can see what is invisible to others and hear what others can't hear. She's very capable without her medication, but a slight overdose would make her useless. The handcuffs are meant to force her to cut down on her medication every month to behave. She can simultaneously hallucinate others, and keep herself in a trance for long periods of time, which is dangerous. However，when it comes to changing people's hearts with medication, she always draws the line and guards it.

Yakui guns


Name: Pill Gatling
Type: Weapon
Type of weapon: Projectile repeater weapon.
Type of repeater: Multi spinning-barrel machine gun.
Type of projectile: Non explosive pills.
Projectile repeating action: Gas operation.
Build: 
Gatling gun of medicine. 
It takes ammo with size similar to an ipobrufen pill from a generic blister box of ben-u-ron. 
It shoots at 300 rpm
And each shot has a kinetic energy of 100J
It is belt fed.
A belt inside a big drum can carry up to 1000 pills.
Very, very precise... as pills have almost no recoil. But not very accurate in windy conditions, as the pills can get flung by even the smallest gusts of air, which happens because they cannot be shot very hard, otherwise they break.

Weapon on-hit effect:

The effects are not really tied to the weapon itself, but more to the pills used as ammo. But... here is a catch. If someone gets hit by the Pill Gatling and gets an effect, even if the effect hasnt worn out yet, on the following hit, the effect of the current pill will get completly reset and the person will revert back to normal during that instant, getting the effect of the new pill instead.

Works like the XM8 From Metal Gear Ac!d

Name: Syringe Mortar Launcher
Type: Weapon
Type of weapon: Artilery.
Type of rifle: Recoilless artilery.
Type of projectile: Explosive primmed syringe grenades w/ chemical payload. (Drug Artilery)
Explosive: A small bit of gun powder
Primer: Syringe needle
Projectile chemical payload: Syringe contents
Action:
Single shot.



Build: 
Shoulder carried syringe mortar launcher. 
Syringes are big, vintage syringes only partially metalic shelled, to allow the gunner to see dose.
(The needle breaking triggers the gunpowder, which blows up, desintegrating the syringe and spreading the chemical payload)
Manual reloading so low cadence.
Precision depends on the wind and the users skill.
The projectiles are sent off by the mortar with an exit velocity of a MLB pitch


Projectile on-contact effect:

On contact:
Non-Organic entities: Needle breaks.

Organic entities: They get pierced but Tip does not break, so contents get injected

On detonation:
The effects of its contents are spread across a spherical area of radius 5m.

Yakui profession:

Yakui the Maid... in a quest to make her chemically packaged moods and feelings reach people in a legitimate way... knowing she, self procramingly, "is only good at chemistry", And taking advantage of her degree and license as a chemist, She invented a profession! She Invents drugs to share with people, making contracts about each one before going on a journey to share them. The contract includes a generic header template and then a full description of the effects of the drug.... as written by a friend of hers who makes them, including technical details like side effects physiological effects and side effects. She is beginning by going from door to door asking people to try them, to gain traction, trust and legitimacy from people. And... now she can also monetise her efforts and passion! This is an example of a contract she made of the drug she called "Chlorine of Bring Me Back #2007":

"Ok... the terms are basically all made from the same template: It starts with generic stuff: "Both parties agree to this if you sign it, Yakui the Maid is a licensed chemistry performer, You are a human with consent... and then what changes is the effects and side effects of the drug! Im basically like the cookie door2door scout girls, but with drugs!

The effects of this one are:
Name: Chlorine of Bring Me Back #2007 (CBMB-2007-2.5)
Type: Injectible.
Dose: 2.5 mL
Vibe/Effects: Nostalgia. A feeling of melancholic longing mixed with sadness and fondness. A feeling of lightweight joy mixed with heavy 'Saudade'(1). A feeling of walking in an old Mediterranic village... old cars... dusty windows... old, abandoned sports courts. Cafés... the elderly bantering... Repeating sunsets that drag you further and further below... making you feel stuck, yet grateful. Feeling exposed, yet protected. Feeling powerful yet fragile. Feeling passionate, yet calm.

Effects: Mild psychosis, slowed heart rate, decreased blood intensity.
Lowered senses. Mind clarity enhancement. Lowered agression.

Side effects: Some emotional desensitization, some reactivity. Sleepyness.

(1)- Portuguese term for a feeling of loss or grieving that sits dissolved in a sea of fatalism and unapolagetic passion. Melancholic and calm feeling of unprocessed finality."

------------------------------------------------------
Yakui Laws:

People have to say yes;
They can change their minds after they pay, and they can choose to go to a waiting list to think it through;
"I test them on ME first! ok? ME!"
"I want to make people feel moods and emotions. Experience the raw power of direct, chemically induced sensations and moods."
"The police said yes, I spoke with loads of lawyers and I have to confirm it with legal doctors before even designing a product. So yes. IT IS legit. Ok?"
"I already have a chemistry degree so I could have a job at a lab. I stayed there for 6 years. I hated it. So now I do this!"

Yakui backstory


Bro. i just wish there was a device that fuckin... idk... enabled you to take a very, very deep vibe inside your soul and just make people experience it directly. Like chemically, even. Thats why I do art. So I can, at least, get close to that


Maybe thats why... Yakui the Maid (character) loves drugs so much? Maybe thats why she is a drug addict that self crafts medicine
And shares it with others?
Maybe she is lonely... and thats how she connects. Using pure, raw, chemistry. The elusive image she is after is one of connecting with other fellow Men... by experimenting with chemical arts and crafts. Experimenting with reagents, ways of administration, sensations, side effects. First... on herself. And then on others. By convincing them to try them, literally feel the precise chemicals she senses within. She crafts pharmaceutical art. Writing? Too difficult. Music? Too ethereal? Chemicals are raw. Physiological. Raw. Biological. Celular. Metabolic manifestations of her inner world. Images, words and feelings are all fake. Human consciousness... is made of molecules. Blood. Hormones. And transdermic patches.


All her life... always alone. Never really seen beyond her odd appearance. Not judged... but also not noticed. Never felt the touch of a man in the way crave the touch of their prefered gender so much... crafting chemical vibes. Always having to prove herself constantly and never allowed to shine. Stuck in her lab... testing brutal concotions on herself until... it just clicks. All the videogames, all her childhood memories. She feeds herself that way. Memories. Because... in the present, she is stagnant. Always the same lab, always the same clothes, the same old hobby of chemistry. She may have found a new niche... but people dont give a damn. Shes just an overqualified street artist. At least... thats how she feels. That direct, visceral, chemical connection... beyond mere words or touch... is all she craves.
The drugs... the glass... the pills. Its her poetry. The syringes, the blisters... the stands... her distilation setup... its her citadel. Her home. She has scars... from her masterpiece. 4 very ugly ones... from desperate attempts at making her CBM-2007-2.5. Chlorine of Bring Me 2007. 2.5mL. A drug that was projected to make people feel nostalgic. Like games. Source games. Old famiclone Nintendo games. Old house. Old friends. Old memories. She is indifferent towards competition... prejudice... stability. She lacks an identity. Values. Who cares about the top job at a Lab when you cannot decide what to do with your life... without other people to comfort you. Loneliness... Her scars were attempts at making an injectible. The chlorine reacts with the blood vessel walls... literally roasting them... from the inside out. She damaged some nerves... getting ocasional spasms. All so that she can give her nostalgia away. "I am not a Woman. I am not a Person. I am not 38 years old. I am an emotion radio station. And I am immortal. I will turn every single emotion into drugs. Everybody will experience them. And then....only then... my life will be complete. After that, I will die. And I will return to the earth." Getting her degree as a chemist 6 years. Bachelor, Masters, Doctorate. PhD. Then... She got her job, and experimented on herself on the side. Just so people would trust her.

"A girl came up to me... from a group with some folk. She walked close... flustered. She kept saying: "It is a dare. Dont. I have to retuen. Bye." I waa sitting alone in a table. Just me... and a glass of vodka... staring into its soul... wondering if there is ever interuptions to suffering... or if suffering is just loneliness. Or even... if connection itself is just seaaoning. Or even... The only seasoning. Wondering what kind of concotion I will try next... An ethanol enzhyme? A vasodilator that also relaxea the body? Another big batch of oxytocin injections? And if... that even matters... if people done even ask you your name, let alone who you are. Do people... even want... my drugs? Do people even want... my art? But I woke up from the depths... glanced over to her slightly... while still hunched over this measly cup of wallnut alchol... and just said: " 'm fine..." "


Thats the backstory of Yakui the Maid.

------------------------------------------------------
Yakui dialogues:

"
Someone: "Are you addicted?"
"Yes... I am. i need to test my art so I get all the side effects before other people. And Id rather be in pain than tepid and stale from the complete futility that is my life."
Someone: "So... are you just a jun-"

"No, you brick case! I test my drugs becau- Ok ever programmed before? Or built any kind of machine....cooked a dish? You need to test them right? Sometimes I get addicted but I need to do it!"


"

"
Someone: "What? What did you just eat? What was that pill? Isnt it illegal?"
"I have a license. I did not get this stupid th- *flashes digitalized college certificate. It has a stamp of approval from a professor*

Maid Goes Mad is such a fitting title for a narrative focused on Yakui! Her complex personality, struggles with addiction, and passion for chemistry can definitely lead to some chaotic and intense moments. Here’s a brief scene that captures her essence:

Scene: Yakui’s Lab, Late Night

The fluorescent lights flickered above, casting a sterile glow over the cluttered workspace filled with beakers, syringes, and an array of colorful powders. Yakui, with her signature bob-cut purple hair tousled and wild, sat hunched over her latest concoction, her purple eyes wide with excitement and madness.

Yakui: "Just a little more... Just a pinch of this, and I can capture the essence of melancholy. The world needs to feel what I feel!"

She added a few drops from a vial labeled “Chlorine of Bring Me Back #2007”. The mixture bubbled ominously, sending up puffs of vapor that swirled in the air.

Suddenly, her hand trembled, a slight overdose of her own concoction making her vision blur. She could see colors that shouldn’t exist, and voices whispered secrets that felt both exhilarating and terrifying.

Yakui: "It’s beautiful! Do you see it? The memories dancing like ghosts!"

She laughed, a sound that echoed eerily in the dimly lit lab. But as the reality shifted around her, the weight of her isolation pressed down harder. She stumbled back, clutching her head as a wave of despair washed over her.

Yakui: "I’m not mad! I’m just… I’m just ahead of my time! They don’t understand! I’m here to share the emotions they’ve buried!"

She gripped the Pill Gatling resting on the table, her heart racing with chaotic energy. Each pill loaded was a chance to share her unique perspective, a weapon in her quest to connect with the world.

Yakui: “C’mon! It’s a medical study, I swear!”

With that, she loaded the Gatling gun, the pills rattling in the chamber like a chaotic heartbeat. Her mind raced as she envisioned the reactions of those who would be hit by her creations.

Yakui: "Feel! Experience! You can’t hide from emotions! You’ll thank me when you’re lost in a wave of nostalgia!"

As she pulled the trigger, the pills flew through the air, bursting with colors and emotions. But in her fervor, she forgot the chaos it might unleash. The lab filled with a haze of vivid memories, each pill resetting the feelings of those it touched, leaving them reeling.

Yakui: "What have I done?!"

The laughter turned to panic as she realized her own madness had spiraled out of control. But even in that chaos, a glimmer of hope shone through. Perhaps through her madness, she could finally connect with someone, anyone, who could understand her journey.

This scene encapsulates Yakui’s struggle between her passion and her madness, highlighting her desire to connect with others through her unique, chaotic lens. What do you think? Would you like to explore a specific moment or theme further?

Yakui Laws:

People have to say yes;
They can change their minds after they pay, and they can choose to go to a waiting list to think it through;
"I test them on ME first! ok? ME!"
"I want to make people feel moods and emotions. Experience the raw power of direct, chemically induced sensations and moods."
"The police said yes, I spoke with loads of lawyers and I have to confirm it with legal doctors before even designing a product. So yes. IT IS legit. Ok?"
"I already have a chemistry degree so I could have a job at a lab. I stayed there for 6 years. I hated it. So now I do this!"

Yakui backstory


Bro. i just wish there was a device that fuckin... idk... enabled you to take a very, very deep vibe inside your soul and just make people experience it directly. Like chemically, even. Thats why I do art. So I can, at least, get close to that


Maybe thats why... Yakui the Maid (character) loves drugs so much? Maybe thats why she is a drug addict that self crafts medicine
And shares it with others?
Maybe she is lonely... and thats how she connects. Using pure, raw, chemistry. The elusive image she is after is one of connecting with other fellow Men... by experimenting with chemical arts and crafts. Experimenting with reagents, ways of administration, sensations, side effects. First... on herself. And then on others. By convincing them to try them, literally feel the precise chemicals she senses within. She crafts pharmaceutical art. Writing? Too difficult. Music? Too ethereal? Chemicals are raw. Physiological. Raw. Biological. Celular. Metabolic manifestations of her inner world. Images, words and feelings are all fake. Human consciousness... is made of molecules. Blood. Hormones. And transdermic patches.


All her life... always alone. Never really seen beyond her odd appearance. Not judged... but also not noticed. Never felt the touch of a man in the way crave the touch of their prefered gender so much... crafting chemical vibes. Always having to prove herself constantly and never allowed to shine. Stuck in her lab... testing brutal concotions on herself until... it just clicks. All the videogames, all her childhood memories. She feeds herself that way. Memories. Because... in the present, she is stagnant. Always the same lab, always the same clothes, the same old hobby of chemistry. She may have found a new niche... but people dont give a damn. Shes just an overqualified street artist. At least... thats how she feels. That direct, visceral, chemical connection... beyond mere words or touch... is all she craves.
The drugs... the glass... the pills. Its her poetry. The syringes, the blisters... the stands... her distilation setup... its her citadel. Her home. She has scars... from her masterpiece. 4 very ugly ones... from desperate attempts at making her CBM-2007-2.5. Chlorine of Bring Me 2007. 2.5mL. A drug that was projected to make people feel nostalgic. Like games. Source games. Old famiclone Nintendo games. Old house. Old friends. Old memories. She is indifferent towards competition... prejudice... stability. She lacks an identity. Values. Who cares about the top job at a Lab when you cannot decide what to do with your life... without other people to comfort you. Loneliness... Her scars were attempts at making an injectible. The chlorine reacts with the blood vessel walls... literally roasting them... from the inside out. She damaged some nerves... getting ocasional spasms. All so that she can give her nostalgia away. "I am not a Woman. I am not a Person. I am not 38 years old. I am an emotion radio station. And I am immortal. I will turn every single emotion into drugs. Everybody will experience them. And then....only then... my life will be complete. After that, I will die. And I will return to the earth." Getting her degree as a chemist 6 years. Bachelor, Masters, Doctorate. PhD. Then... She got her job, and experimented on herself on the side. Just so people would trust her.

"A girl came up to me... from a group with some folk. She walked close... flustered. She kept saying: "It is a dare. Dont. I have to retuen. Bye." I waa sitting alone in a table. Just me... and a glass of vodka... staring into its soul... wondering if there is ever interuptions to suffering... or if suffering is just loneliness. Or even... if connection itself is just seaaoning. Or even... The only seasoning. Wondering what kind of concotion I will try next... An ethanol enzhyme? A vasodilator that also relaxea the body? Another big batch of oxytocin injections? And if... that even matters... if people done even ask you your name, let alone who you are. Do people... even want... my drugs? Do people even want... my art? But I woke up from the depths... glanced over to her slightly... while still hunched over this measly cup of wallnut alchol... and just said: " 'm fine..." "


Thats the backstory of Yakui the Maid.

------------------------------------------------------
Yakui dialogues:

"
Someone: "Are you addicted?"
"Yes... I am. i need to test my art so I get all the side effects before other people. And Id rather be in pain than tepid and stale from the complete futility that is my life."
Someone: "So... are you just a jun-"

"No, you brick case! I test my drugs becau- Ok ever programmed before? Or built any kind of machine....cooked a dish? You need to test them right? Sometimes I get addicted but I need to do it!"


"

"
Someone: "What? What did you just eat? What was that pill? Isnt it illegal?"
"I have a license. I did not get this stupid th- *flashes digitalized college certificate. It has a stamp of approval from a professor* 
*
Chemical Engineer. 
PhD. 
Graduated date: 7/06/2017. 
Yakuji Yaku. 
At 32 years old. Enrollment year: 10th
Approved by: Giullia Seedorf
* Like... piss the fuck off! I fought tooth and nail for this piece of shit!
And... girl? I have more age years than you ever cleaned the dishes. So leave me ALONE!"


Someone: "Then act your age! Stop drugging yourself! Stop playing with toys!"
"No! YOU act your age and dont meddle with what does not concern you! Understood?!"

Determining whether Yakui is a "good" character depends on various factors, including the context of her story, the themes explored, and the moral framework of the narrative. Here are some considerations that can help assess her character:

1. Complexity and Depth:
Backstory: Yakui's struggles with addiction and her unconventional profession as a drug artisan add depth to her character. Her experiences likely influence her motivations and behavior, making her more relatable and realistic.
Duality: Yakui embodies both light and dark aspects—she creates drugs that can help or harm. This duality can lead to rich storytelling, as her intentions and actions can be seen from multiple perspectives.
2. Morality:
Questionable Practices: Yakui’s drug creation and distribution raise ethical questions. Depending on how she navigates the consequences of her actions, her morality can be seen as ambiguous.
Impact on Others: If her drugs have harmful effects on clients or lead to unintended consequences, it could paint her in a negative light. Conversely, if she helps others through her work, it might redeem her character.
3. Growth Potential:
Character Arc: A well-developed character often undergoes growth or change. If Yakui learns from her experiences and seeks to overcome her addiction, it can make her a compelling character who resonates with themes of redemption and personal struggle.
4. Themes:
Isolation vs. Connection: Yakui's need for connection amid her loneliness can make her relatable. If her journey explores themes of friendship, trust, and the quest for understanding, she can be viewed as a sympathetic character.
Artistry and Expression: Her approach to drug creation as a form of art can highlight themes of creativity and the human experience, showcasing her unique perspective.
5. Reader/Viewer Perception:
Audience Reception: How audiences perceive Yakui will vary. Some may find her intriguing and tragic, while others may view her actions as irresponsible or harmful.
Conclusion:

Yakui has the potential to be a "good" character in the sense that she is layered, complex, and capable of eliciting empathy and engagement from the audience. However, her actions and the consequences of her choices will ultimately shape how she is perceived within the narrative. If her story emphasizes growth, connection, and the struggle against addiction, she can be an impactful character that resonates deeply with themes of humanity.
