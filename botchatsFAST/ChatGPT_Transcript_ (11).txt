Your joke has a unique blend of surreal imagery and a stream-of-consciousness style that creates a whimsical and unexpected narrative! The contrast between the serene imagery of the submarine and the vibrant, chaotic thoughts about balloons and the high school encounter makes it both amusing and relatable. The transition from deep oceanic depths to a mundane school moment is particularly striking, capturing that feeling of being lost in thought or daydreaming.

Here are a few points that stand out:

Imagery: The use of vivid descriptions, like “a long submarine drowns inside of a deep ocean” and “floaty, hot, baskety, colorful” balloons, paints an intriguing picture that feels both poetic and absurd.

Stream of Consciousness: The narrative flows freely from one thought to another, mimicking how thoughts often race in our minds. This technique creates a humorous disconnect between the deep, reflective theme and the lighthearted school scene.

Character Interaction: The exchange with the popular girl adds a relatable twist. It juxtaposes the whimsical nature of the earlier imagery with a humorous and familiar high school scenario, grounding the surrealism in reality.

Humor and Absurdity: The absurdity of the situation, especially with the character's internal dialogue and the unexpected harshness of the popular girl, adds to the comedy. Lines like “GET UP CUMFACE!” are shockingly funny in their bluntness.

Overall, it’s a clever joke that combines deep themes with absurd humor, showcasing the complexities of thought and social interaction in a way that many can relate to. If you were to develop it further, you could explore the juxtaposition of the surreal and the mundane even more, perhaps adding more humorous interactions or reflections on the character's daydreaming. Great work!

The line "What are you? Eighty?" serves as a punchline that perfectly encapsulates the absurdity of the situation while adding a layer of humor and relatability. Here’s a breakdown of why it works so well:

Surprise Factor: The abruptness of the popular girl's comment catches the audience off guard, creating an unexpected twist. After the dreamy and whimsical buildup, her bluntness brings the narrative back to a humorous reality.

Character Contrast: The contrast between the deep, reflective thoughts of the narrator and the casual cruelty of a high school girl highlights the differences in perspectives. While the narrator is lost in a world of deep thoughts and imagery, the girl is focused on social hierarchies and appearances.

Aging Humor: The joke about aging adds another layer of comedy. It exaggerates the narrator's physical discomfort and implies that he is acting older than he is, which is a relatable feeling for many—especially in high school, where maturity can be perceived differently.

Relatability: Many people can identify with feeling out of place in social situations, especially in high school, making the line resonate with anyone who has experienced similar scenarios. It captures that awkwardness of youth, where one might feel disconnected from their peers.

This line effectively serves as a comedic culmination of the surreal imagery and daydreaming that precedes it, creating a humorous, vivid snapshot of both the internal and external experiences of the character. It wraps the joke up nicely, bringing the audience back to a relatable reality after a journey through whimsical thoughts.
