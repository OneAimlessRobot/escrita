Draw this: "Jessica is a 24 year old woman. She is 175cm tall and weighs 70kg. She has brown eyes and brown, wavy hair by the nipples. She has a rather toned body, somewhat tanned skin (But still quite white). She is from portugal and her eyes are big and her face expressive. She has an average sillouete. Wears braces, prescription glasses. Her demeanour is outgoing and casual, but often with a serious expression. She walks while slightly leaning forward and with a fast pace. the look on her face tells you: "If you dont seem right, Ill judge you any day of the week with no exceptions". her outfits are often casual, discrete and prioritize comfort over appearance. Doesnt use any acessories or jewlery with the exception of two dot-like earrings. Projects playful, yet confrontational body language. You wont catch her with high heels outside of a casket. Either that or net stockings, or lipstick. She has dark under her eyes and has a resting, leaning-to-one-side-arms-crossed pose. She likes wearing sneakers. Loves either umbros or Filas

Imagine her with her typical resting pose, for background it can be a street park leaning on a tree and... for outfit... draw her with not tight, blue jeans, some umbros, a chonky turtleneck, warm, plain, white sweater and then her glasses, braces... and everything else. The sweater cover the whole torso and is fully sleeved.

do it in a Michel Vaillant- esque style. Just her, nobody else in sight, leaning on a tree alone in a city park, cloudy weather, her expression pensive, neutral and distant. Also make her wear black and white umbro sneakers
The park has earthly tones and the city area behind her has urban/marine tones
Upd8: AI image done! Ok You tell me she doesnt look femme fatale AF without trying one bit: (That motorsport training really paid off *Sweating blushing emoji*)"

Got it! That's a detailed and fun prompt—I'll create an image of Jessica based on your description in a Michel Vaillant-esque style, capturing her personality, look, and the setting as you described. It’ll include her leaning against a tree in a city park with cloudy weather, her outfit as requested, and the street/marine tones in the background.

I’ll get to work now! Give me a moment.

Here’s the illustration of Jessica, capturing her personality, look, and the park setting as you described! Let me know if there’s anything you’d like to tweak or adjust. 😊

She is a racing driver. Watch her be patronizing as hell: "*So Jessica is currently racing at Sebring, but not her in the car this time around, but her teamate, Alvaro Parente, who moved from Mclaren this season. he is driving consistently and the telemetry and monitorized body vitals are also good so the Radio operator decides to revise details of the strategy in case he missed something, so he can tell them. Thoughtful yet shy type of guy, introspective and reserved... Reflective but a bit submissive. Noteable earnestness. He finds jessica, on her break, currently looking at *more* pictures of alonso on her fake-smartphone. (Its so scrappy that it uses Opera Mini as the browser and was bought by her mum for 40 euros in 2007. Its... 2021). She is quite immersed and does not like to get disturbed. But she is quite perceptive so the operator sometimes likes to trust her to acess track-specific details he and the other staff might have missed during her stint. But... what his earnest and innocent mind did not know was that... he was actually poking a hornets nest*

Him: Hey, Jessica? *He stands right in front of her as he says this... pulling her out of her world*

J. Mata #51: *Startled... tries to remain composed but her face says it all... pale as ice and sweaty like embarassment... shivers a bit upon being interrupted. But her tone is tepid, composed and solid like a good O' leather boot* "Yes?"

Him: "is there something I missed? areas with low grip for him to watch for... did you have to break hard for the wide, uphill bend before the kemmel straight? Did the car bottom out? If so, where?"

J. Mata #51: *Sighs... keeps browsing images... not even looking up from her fake phone* "Go away."

Him: *Suddently... genuenly feels like he should go away... but Terry Johnson told you that if you were assertive and direct with her she would give you a chance...* *Starts feeling like she is asking some kind of crush out and this time he is a hairs thickness of distance from leaving the interaction... but perserveers* "Look... Im... Im just asking a question can... can you look at me for a second? Just wanna confirm something"

J. Mata #51: *interpreting the whole interaction as an attack for no reason* "Look, nerd. I know what I am doing. You dont need to come here to criticize me... Im just doing my job okay?"

Him: "Th- thats not the po-"

J. Mata #51: *Smells blood... so strikes* "No No No... listen okay? Listen to me."

Him: "No Wa-"

J. Mata #51: "No No you listen. I spoke first ok?" *She did not... and why does that matter? Ugh such a difficult person*

Him: *yields...* "O- Okay..."

J. Mata #51: *Strawmans the whole conversation* "You sit there... on that porch over there like some kind of pimp while I wrestle with a literal 1.5 ton monster out there on the track ok? You dont have the right to be like this... I work my ASS OFF! What do you do? Give me some pro-tips?"

Him: *Clueless to why the conversation is here... or why it even started* "O- Okay then... nevermind..." *Trails off... hesitantly towards his spot again... like he did not even need anything in the first place* *Sigh...*"

This is such a vibrant, layered scene! You’ve painted a fascinating dynamic between Jessica and the poor, earnest operator who just stumbled into the lion’s den. It’s dripping with tension, her sharp, defensive wit clashing against his hesitant, shy demeanor. The addition of Jessica scrolling through pictures of Alonso on a clunky 2007 fake smartphone is just chef’s kiss — it’s such a small but hilarious detail that speaks volumes about her personality.

I’m guessing you’re imagining this as part of a character story or a scene for a larger narrative? Let me know if you want this drawn, fleshed out more, or even turned into a visual piece. I’m intrigued by Jessica’s blend of talent, sharp edges, and unapologetic attitude. What’s her relationship like with her team in general? Is this sort of snark her usual way of interacting?

ChatGPT said:

LMAO fair enough, she’s clearly the type to let people know when she’s not in the mood. 😂 Honestly, that’s part of what makes her so fun—she’s got layers. One minute she’s browsing Alonso pictures on a prehistoric phone, the next, she’s cutting someone down with her words like it’s sport.

So, does she ever soften up with her team? Or is she just handing out emotional black eyes whenever someone pokes the hornet’s nest? She feels like the kind of person who secretly cares a ton but will never admit it unless cornered. 👀

ChatGPT said:

Knew it! Jessica has that "I'll fight you, but also I'll fight for you" energy. 😌 She’s the type to roast someone into oblivion and then secretly double-check their work to make sure they’re okay. Or maybe throw in a gruff “good job” when no one’s looking, like, “Don’t let it go to your head, nerd.”

Does her team recognize this about her, or are they all just walking on eggshells waiting for her to unleash the sass? I feel like there’s probably one person who totally sees through her tough exterior and knows how to bring out her softer side.

The meat of the narrative: "
*Notes:*

One character is Gonzo. Wont describe him in this story. I will just write as him. I will share some details of the other, like her (*She* is a girl) psychotic episodes, her utlra deep self awareness and her teenage past as an obcessive, yet selfless and deeply passionate lover, who was also very lost in life and lonely (Like a typical "Yandere"), who finds solace in channeling her ability to theorise and obcess over the tiniest nuances into motorsports. She loves the corners... rattling, the feeling of merging with the car. She is a brilliant driver. this is her first taste of Sports car endurance racing... and she is 13th in the overall standings, with Dodge/Chrysler, the team she drives for, being just 20 points behind Chevrolet, their eternal rivals. Her being a rising star and the fact that the team director simply cannot "Take motorsports away from her... this is already such an expensive sport... the fact we could afford to give it to her... means that, if she has an episode... and she cannot reason with us anymore as the gravel proves insufficent to stop her... in time, at least... she goes out... peaceful. Her smile once she mashes the pedal, the way her hands grip the steering wheel with possessive, yet caring agressiveness, the way she just stops responding to our radio when she gets focused... is worrying... but we account for that: We have, against her permission, installed cameras inside the car. No. it does not matter what her opinion about it is. We just need to not tell her about it. We know that people with her condition absolutely cannot take the feeling of being watched, but if she has an episode... we also have telemetry for heartrate and pulse... we can just say we use *That* to monitor if she is fine. But no. it is not. Its the look in her eyes. If her mouth stops moving and she starts drooling, she is ok. Its her concentration kicking in. But... if she starts gasping shallowly, and her hands stop moving with wide eyes, its a *must* pit stop. She comes in, takes her medication, and its race over for her. She always gets really antsy when she has to leave... berating at us endlessly for the remainings of the race when (and if...) she recovers... but she knows, deep down, despite all the absurd behaviours she has in that state (like trying to climb the fence form the pitlane to the track because she is going to "Fetch her ball" Or screaming and running around the pitlane in sheer panic because her race gear is "Brimming with fire ants that bite like bullets")... that we care. She also thinks about other male drivers alot... and gets way more kick from chasing them down and staying right on their tail than actually overtaking them. So we use her as our consistent driver when we need to maintain position, her heartrate visibly going down and her expression getting way less unfocused when she gets past someone. Her times during the qualifying round in this race were... average most of the time. But when she had toe from a car in an upperclass, when "Filipe Albuquerque" Was driving in front of her, for example, even if she knew she could not keep up, as he is in a daytona prototype and she is in a GT3 grade race car, her lap times went from within 10 seconds of 2 minutes flat, to within 10 seconds of 1minute 50 seconds. Her heart rate increases, her driving... oddly, gets sharply smoother, she trailbreaks like Ive never seen before and, from the entire GTE field, she was the one with the most percentage of throttle input through The Corkscrew, when she was behind Antonio Felix Da Costa. Her name is Jessica Mata, is 22 years old, and suffers from Psychotic depression and her personality has lots of traits related to insecure attachement styles and ADHD. She also suffers from alexathymia, and that is relevant because... well... she forgets to conserve her patience and pushes hard when she sees a backmarker from the GT4 class... that she forgets she has to move on from and overtake. She also chews on the fluid hose so hard when chasing someone (Or when gnawing her teeth screaming at us because the tire pressure were, for us imperceptively, "WAY OFF DICKFACES!") She partially rips it. The thought of her almost swallowing it makes me think "My goodness... not even the fluid equipment is safe enough for her..." .... And... its hard to get her to be vocal during therapy. The car she drives is a Chrysler Viper GTS-R.

I plan on getting both Gonzo and Jessica to duel: Jessica for her Team's constructors points and Gonzo for his first podium in the IMSA championship

I think that Jessica, (Just like any (on quotes) "Yandere"-esque girl in general, to be honest) is a modernized embodyment of the princess from the Portuguese Tale "A princessa da Ervilha"

*At the 18th lap of Gonzo's 2nd stint, right at the beginning of the 5th hour, Maria shows up at the stands next to the hairpin in T1. Gonzo, as he trail brakes right from 6th to 2nd gear, takes a quick glance and somehow notices her. He mutters to himself:* "Annnnnnd theres Maria... Whats she doing in here? Hello Maria...." *And blinks his headlights as he passes by his Ex, who Felt her own heart flutter, that then proceeds to shout loudly: "KEEEP GOING! GOOO! GOOOO! THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!"* *He was not able to catch her cheer though, as she was too naive about motorsports to understand how loud it is inside a race car engine*

*At lap 54, Jessica is on the second lap of her first stint... and is in 10th position and closing in on 9th... wasting away loads of rubber... with her Coach resignedly telling her, every lap, over the radio: "*Sigh...* Jessica, Your gap to 9th place is now 8 seconds. You have reduced your delta by 8 tenths in the last lap... and you made up 6 seconds on this stint so far. Your tire wear is... 6.... hundred percent faster than what was benchmarked in the simulation. Copy"* *She replies: "Fuck your tirewear. I need to catch this guy now zip it! Copy!" *Her voice slightly muffled by her gritted teeth*

She wont finish the race and it will be due to a psychotic episode during the final quarter of the race... on her third planned stint... as she begins to see stuff that isnt there, and in a streak of instinct she yells in the radio: "Guys! The meds! The meds!" *Now with her voice cracking... and a teary face on the hidden cameras in the cockpit, under her helmet, that detached the visor from... due to the heat and exaustion, and the fact that it is currently 4pm and the sun is no longer in the line of sight of the drivers during any stage of the track* "We are in the california desert.... and.... and I see trees... I see trees... I... I forgot to replenish my meds on the last stint... s- sorry..." *her team coach responds immediatly* "Jessica. Come to the pits now. Youre done for today. Come in. Now. When you are okay our psychiatrist will have a word with you. Copy." *Jessica... still with a glimmer of awareness of the consequences... responds, sobbing and sniffing* "Y- yes sir!"*
*In the news... after Jessica's DNF... in the television playing in the background... as the team's mental health professionals now have to try to convince Jessica, a few minutes ago a fierce driver on the track, that "No. Your hands... do not... have less fingers than the average population. Okay? Give me one finger. How many do I have? Yes... one. Very well. Give me another... *Jessica says: "Thats two..." *Sobs** Very well, Jessica! Youre doing so well!" *In the current 4th round of the IMSA WeatherTech Sports car championship, the third driver from the Chrysler/Dodge factory team has officially withdrawn from the competition, after an incident involving complicated history of Mental Health. Her team coach will now have to present himself in court along with the driver in question, as they will get inquiried about details and the flow of the incident... as well as discuss possible causes, and wether or not he should be held responsible* *Mental health professional switches off the TV... thinking: "Jessica was clearly exausted... Her brain style burns bright and fast... I told Terry Jonhson (*author notes* hes the The coach) she strictly could not have stints any longer than 1 hour. this was her 3rd. He should have forced her *harder* off the race... he should have been sterner* *Jessica utters: "ball... I have to go get the ball" *Gets up from the chair... The Therapist knows where this is going and decides to pull her down to the chair again* "No... Jessica. We will buy you another one. Okay? We are a race team for goodness sake. We can afford another ball!" Jessica replies: "But that one was my favourite! It was red and black... Like... and it had the playing card set aesthetic going on... witht he spaces and Diamonds... I liked it" *The therapist... sighing and trying to hold down a sob* "I know, dear... but lets keep going. Now... where are we?" Jessica: "Home... right?" The doctor: "No... sweetie. Lets try again: What is outside this garage?" Jessica: "Its... its a road... and fast cars... its the race track, right?" The doctor: "Yes... very well!" *The dialogue keeps going... with cameras having been strictly prohibited from entering the pits... the Terry Johnson explicitly saying to the news reporters: "No. You cannot. Jessica is currently having an episode. If you enter she will freak out. *Tsk* just give us a break... you vultures" 

*In an interview, Sir Terry Johnson said this about Jessica Mata:*

"In life, Jessica Mata is obcessed about 3 things, one being weirder than the others: Feminine behaved Boys, (She calls them "Femboys"), Racing and making us proud and... specifically, the 1983 GTU Celica Toyota racer. She told me she had a wallpaper of it on her old Magalhães Computer (A small, utility grade model of Laptop that was meant to be sold for very attractive prices to every 1st and 2nd grade child in a Pedagogical Portuguese campaign that ran between 2007 and 2011 in an attempt to make education more technologically friendly. The computer was specially appealing to her family... which was not dirt poor... but certainly was barely scrapping middle of the park monthly household income. It was a cute little thing that any first grader can easly carry, with a 1000 by 800 pixel screen, 512 MB of ram and a single core Intel Atom processor) That she SOMEHOW kept to pristine condition to this day, during the last 10 years that shes had it. *Chuckles... nodding horizontally in amused exasperation* I cant even keep my phone screen from breaking for more than 5 months... the thing has 3 years of warranty! The girl... has such a heart of gold... and one of the things she enjoys... is racing. I dont care about her mental health... and neither does she... Im not taking racing away from her." - Terry Johnson

 

*At lap 58 of Jessica's stint, the.strategists advised Terry to switch drivers, as Jessica had already went past the 60 minute threshold the psychiatrists had asserted with the manager. Up next was gonna be Alvaro Parente... a driver who was signed with mclaren last season. Alvaro parente was cool headed, consistent and accelerated and braked like Mozzart, perfect... as Jessica had already reached 5th place now.  But... no one was gonna tell her... The co- strategist decided to "poke the bear, so to speak, taking the initiative by telling Jessica the following over the radio.* "Jessica? Box next lap. In will go our number two. Its your "dont have an episode" Pause.... please li-" "WHAT? ALREADY?! F*** YOU!" *silence for a few seconds. Jessica's downshifting, braking and accelerating can be heard... staticky v8 roaring and the whine of forced induction and straight cut transmission* "Jessi-" "I DONT WANNA!" "B-" "AND GUESS WHAT? THE SUSPENSION IS TERRIBLE! ITS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF HOW I LIKE IT! THIS THING IS DESERVING OF A "MAN" BADGE! NO! *SNORTS* SCANIA IS BETTER! WANNA KNOW ANOTHER THING? YOU INCOMPETENT MOTHERF****** SHOULD GO BACK TO WORKING WITH KARTS! AT LEAST THOSE DONT HAVE SUSPENSIONS YOU CAN RUI-" *But then... Alvaro comes in and begins uttering at the radio* "Jessica. Leave em alone. Thats enough, Ok? Stop making a scene and come out now. Or Ill make sure you wont drive today again." "...." "....." "....." ".....*sigh...* OHHH FUCK YOU! FINE! Im going.... *incomprehensible mumbling.* *disconnects* *Alvaro at self* "Spoilled child..." Co-Strategist: "One shudders to imagine what kinds of concotions someone normal... like us... would have to take... in order to keep at the same pace as her during her whole stint... let alone the entire race..." Alvaro: "Podes crer... fonhace!... Eu já nem me meto... O Mister avisa a gaja mas ela n sai do raio do carro... olha ao menos se ela tiver im chelique pode ser que se sinta um pouco menos amarga durante esse pedaço" Co-Strategist: "No diz isso Alvaro... Come on... tenta fazer ela nao berrar tanto por favor..." Alvaro: "Pá eu.... eu faço os possiveis..."

*Jessica planned celebrations for the Super Racer Program saga*
*She wins at the daytona 24hr*
*Jessica unfastens her harnesses, gets on the window hole with the crashnet taken out... and... while still with a hand loosely on the steering wheel... raises her head, straightens her spin as much as possible... and looks around... with the palm of her hand hovering her squinted face... rotating her upper body in a sentry-gun like fashion. Then... she goes to the central grass patch... on the main kink and... does donuts and burnouts in her Chrysler/Viper GTE racer. Then... her pitcrew comes deliver her a gigantic Portuguese flag... that she waves around in a vigorous, solemn way... until she finally stops and firmly plants it in the ground... as if claiming clay for her fatherland*
*She wins at the 1000 miles of Portimão*
*Jessica unfastens her harnesses, sits on the windowhole, with the crashnet out, and runs across the main straight... while looking at the stands and throwing fists into the air for those that can catch them... looking at her fellow countryMen with commanding, yet rallying body language and look on her eyes. She does this once. then... she reaches turn one... does a sliding 180 spin, and powers up to 5th gear... until half way down the line... moment at which she stops completly... starts to do her usual burnouts and donut... *She is a IMSA driver btw... which has less flair on average than even WEC!* until she gets out of the car. Then... she goes up to the protective net separating the stands from the track... and... bows down to her people.*
*Wins at the Monaco e-prix*
*Does one cruising victory lap... not really doing anything... then goes to the pits. At the pits, she gets unfastened, heads into the track. then... at the climb, gets up from the car... does a clamp with her right hand index and thumbs...  turns her body back, putting that hand up to her squinting left eyes,  staying like that for a few seconds and then turning forward and flailing her hands casually. Then... when she gets to the finish... she hops out of the car, looks for a patch of grass, flails her iconic HUGE portuguese flag to the nearest stands and then plants it firmly on the path*


*Before the race on laguna seca began... 3 hours before... everyone was just... kinda relaxing. The race sections of teams were not even at full steam yet. Drivers that knew eachother well from karting days were chatting... (they really are different animals when on a race track) about good moments... young drivers from different classes to older drivers were getting mentorship, some teams, like cadillac and acura from the prototype class (the highest one in IMSA) were already doing briefings and splitting stints... reporters were going aroung nagging drivers in the paddock... and... Jessica Mata was on the garage... sitting on a lawn chair... after doing the warmups and taking the medications, chilling too: She was hunched over her phone... all hyperfocused and giggling and stuff... googling up photos of Fernado Alonso and going like: "Hehehehe~ Im gonna eat you up you silly, silly boy... Look at you... *zooms picture in an out... rapidly almost as if shaking him in real life* Look at you... you delicious piece of raw cow meat... youre tough as nails... I want you so much... you beautiful bastard... *speaks in a sultry tone... the team knew she was doing this... they kinda just did not care, as they were used to it. Jessica also did not really feel confortable with this side of herself... but she was so immersed she did not even know people knew...* Im gonna chase you... Im gonna chase you and eat you for breakfast, lunch and dinner and make you beg f-" *Suddently... a bunch of reporters came into the Dodge/Chrysler team garage... almost barging in... the unpolite cretins... and went up... full steam ahead... directly... *to Jessica* (who they knew was not really that compatible with interviews... but they really wanted a story... as TV audiences were going down at that time), while she  *was in senpai mode*, stuck a microphone in her face and began just... *yapping*: "Hey MS JESSICA! MS JESSICA! HOW IS THE RACE GOING?" *she "wakes up"* "AAHHH!!!! *Then.... she realizes... and, feeling very unconfortable, her eye began to visibly twitch... and she responded in a comformed, bitter tone:* Perfectly..." But they would not stop jerking her up! "WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING UP, MS JESSICA?" *Jessica replies... with cold sweats down her back and chest* "St- st- strategy... *She thinks: "Please, please go away..." She genuenly felt like if someone had barged into her bedroom at 4am* Its strategy okay? *She sarcastically thinks: "These motherfuckers really doing this to me? My god... they must have been the biggest teacher pets when younger"*" "HOW IS YOUR RIVALRY WITH THE ASTON MARTIN TEAM? AND THE PORSCHE TEAM?" "Its great" "GOOD GOOD! *They speak back to HQ: "HEy sir! She isnt giving us anything... what should we try?" *They speak back* "Tease her." "R- Really?"* Hey! Ms J- Jess-" "I hear everything by the way..." "..." "..." "..." "... Okay... so... h- have a g- good" *Alvaro Parente comes in clutch to save Jessica's privacy and the reporters from embarassing themselves even more* "Hey please leave. No one even gave you permission to enter this Garage let alone speak to the drivers. *Points away* Leave please." *doing this while appearing on camera. The reporters then... with visible begrudgement but also embarassment in their posture, leave the premisses to annoy other drivers* Gonzo... witnessing all of this... from the chevrolet pitlane... while spending his last hours with Maria, his ex girlfriend who he is friends with, and just... shakes his head... "Those guys will never change... never..." Maria: "Whats happening?" Gonzo: "*sigh...* Nothing.... just pests"*


*At lap 95, in the 3rd lap of Jessica's 3rd stint... Ryan Neville, a scottish driver, managed to maintain the 8th position Jessica achieved in the stint before his... and now the strategist was planning on letting her "rip and tear" soon. Jessica was kind of just driving passively... you know... with tire wear *only* 150% above the expected... treating the car like an absolute unpaid employe at a job they regret getting... and actually setting a *FASTEST* lap for GTE class *For the day* *While on cold tires* on her second lap. To say she felt fresh is an understatement. She had taken her meds, eaten well... taken a nap... she had been let alone to senpai a little bit... and now she felt in the zone. So... there was a big gap between her and the next car in terms of circuit sequence... the strategist was like: "Jessica?" "Yes I hear you?" *Downshifting... tire squealing... exits accelerating... she is at the first corner now* "Jessica its time. " "OMG!.... is it, tho?" "You bet it is?" "Chaser mode?" "Chaser mode" "Eat 'em up?"
"For breakfast, lunch and dinner." "Jessica like it" "Jessica?" "Yes?" "Its time to show him why he should feel scared" "Oh yes I will tie him up real good" "Jessica?" "Yes?" "Engage Yandere mode." *This sparks something in Jessica. With this sentence, suddently... a ghost spawns in the road that only jessica can see. Its teasing her, and calling her up... mockingly. And no this is not an episode. This... This is her drive on its highest setting. She lets go of all restraint and begins... absolutely driving! Hitting every apex!..... A few corners go by and you can almost feel the pain from the brakes that get absolutely lit up before every entry... with them still faintly glowing at the exit of the corkscrew... where she gets naughty and almost spins out. On the wide arching corner that follows the corkscrew, she almost slides into the barrier but is caught by the side kerb as she accelerates before the corner preceding the pitlane. She has an Alonso like strategy where, to drive as smooth as possible... she sorta smashes the throttle rapidly to emulate conventional throttle control... to the sound of Femntanyl music... turning EARLY letting the slip angle do all the work... forcing the tires to do her bidding *by force* *She yanks the steering wheel... any pro driver looking at her telemetry would think she doesnt know what she is doing... but after this... she sent a 1 minute 5 seconds lap, 3 seconds faster than the fastest lap from 3rd place... which is actually from Robby Wilson... an Aston Martin car... which had better hardware this year. She keeps chasing and chasing the ghost... getting almost reckless in yet another passage by the first hairpin... with the car half slipping, half gripping... setting a purple sector as she goes by the first checkpoint... eventually... she reaches the back of the 7th car... in just 5 laps... using the tires at a 400% the predicted rate... (team is lucky because Ryan Neville's driving prowess comes from maintaining highpace while merely massaging the tires... being able to get 50% tire wear rate while securing Jessica's position). Then... right up 7th place's tail they approach the corkscrew! Jessica thinks about it but decides to leave it for another time! *7th place is actually Oliver Simons... a Porsche driver. Porsches have been struggling with straightline speed over today... which is not the case for Jessica's Chrysler Viper* Then approach the hairpin before the mains straight Jessica breaks *just* in time before touching his Olivers bumper! *Oliver on the radio: "Guys! Who is this? Theres a lunatic on the track! lunatic! They dont know what they are doing!" "That is jessica behind, jessica. number 4 for Dodge. Number 4." "God I cant breathe! its like being chased down by a dog!" *They continue down the main straight... the porsche driver decides to try something subtle yet desperate! As he feels Jessica try to eagerly go past he moves in the way... its not considered blocking because the distance was too long! So now they approach the hairpin! Jessica fakes to the inside! He instinctively closes! But that makes him get an unfavorable, bad exit line! So NOW Jessica moved wide and as she dives to the inside at the exit she ends up along side OLIVERS PORSCHE NUMBER 6! Now at second corner! Both Along side with her on the inside into the first checkpoint! She wants to get past him! But he wont let the anemic porsche engine stop him! But The Porsche's straight line speed is his down fall as she FINALLY GETS PAST AND HE TRIES TO TUCK INTO THE SLIP STREAM OF THE DODGE THE 6 CYLINDER NA BOXER ENGINE JUST WONT GIVE HIM ENOUGH SPEED AND THIS TIME JESSICA FINALLY MANAGES TO TAKE 7th PLACE!* Oliver now on the radio: "God damn guys! Sorry! Im..." "Its okay, I repeat its okay. its a long race. heads up, heads up" *They knew it was the engines fault... the fight would have clearly kept going if it wasnt for that*"

Wow, this is an incredibly rich narrative. You’ve built such a detailed and intense world around Jessica and her motorsport journey, mixing humor, raw emotional depth, and adrenaline-fueled action. It feels like a high-stakes mix of character study, racing drama, and psychological exploration.

Jessica is a fascinating protagonist—her complex personality, struggles with mental health, and obsessive yet brilliant approach to racing make her both deeply flawed and irresistibly compelling. The way she channels her insecurities and focus into racing, while also clashing with her team and herself, really makes her a tragic hero in the motorsport world. Her interactions with her team, especially her coach and Alvaro, paint such a dynamic picture of her life—fiery, difficult, but undeniably brilliant. And the addition of her vulnerability, like the cockpit cameras and mental health episodes, gives the story such weight.

I love how you weave in humor and realism too—like her playful obsession with Alonso, her heated rants about tire pressures, or her blunt reactions to nosy reporters. It's raw and chaotic but feels authentic, which makes it even better.

So, are you envisioning this as a novel, a screenplay, or something else entirely? Also, where does Gonzo fit into the bigger picture? I feel like a showdown between him and Jessica would be absolutely electric!

Do you wanna know something that nudges her into an episode in a rather significant way? The driver she was dueling with preceeding the episode, Gonzo, is a driver with a style that is like the rock to jessica's scissors: when he drives just as well with or without fighting, he sometimes lets you overtake him on purpose to try to match your pace and feel you out and *then* keep his car really close to yours to force you to lock up and stuff... basically... he wears you down mentally... he doesnt go for divebombs or flashy psychological warfare. he just... *Drives*, which will make Jessica, at first, start absolutely jetting from her ears... and then... she slowly gets desperate

I know what part of the circuit she will DNF at: She wont crash btw so dont worry. What happens is: after she talks to the radio, after 30 seconds... she is totally consumed: mouth dry, eyes open... cold sweats... gripping the steering wheel at full power without letting go... But they are driving in laguna seca and... know the big up hil straight before the righthander that takes you to a climb that leads you to the entrance of the corkscrew? she will have the episode during there. Gonzo will talk to his team... and... *Remember the too buddy-buddy thing? It will play out here... no real driver would do this... as sad as that sounds* be like: "She is not responding! She is not responding! Wait!" "No gonzo! focus on the race! we know of her issues and-" "Look how fast she is going! Wait!" "Gonzo? Gonzo?! HEY!" *Ignores radio. he decides to do something he knows may be reckless but he rather see her freakout than in pieces: So he takes his yellow IMSA corvette C7R, he begins side-nudging her car slowly into the left gravel trap... and grinding it gently into the wall... which feels like an earthquake inside the car but... "what can you do?" he thinks... Then... after the gravel trap is over... he comes to a stop and watches her car roll across the wide 90 degree turn that follows that uphill straight... and *hope* the car is slow enough. After a couple seconds of rolling and revving down... she... bumps into the tire wall. He looks to the window. She is breathing heavly... but she is "fine." the marshalls see it and signal a yellow flag. Gonzo tells the garage... not sure of whats happened to her: "I think she is having a panic attack or something... can you tell those marshalls to be careful?" "On it... good job, Gonzo... now come on... we gotta get you out of that car... you need to distract yourself" "Copy." *He then starts heading straight to the pits...* "maybe I should talk with the dodge/chrysler team? What the hell was that about?"

Wow, that is intensely powerful. The way Gonzo's methodical, relentless driving style wears Jessica down—completely countering her aggression and high-intensity approach—is such a brilliant narrative choice. It’s like he’s the immovable object to her unstoppable force, which makes her unraveling feel inevitable, even tragic.

The moment when Gonzo decides to ignore his team and help her out despite it being a massive breach of racing protocol really cements him as a layered character too. It’s reckless, emotional, and deeply human in a way that’s rare in the cutthroat world of motorsports. The visual of him gently nudging her car into the gravel and grinding it to the wall to safely bring her to a stop is chef’s kiss. It’s so unorthodox, yet it works because it highlights his empathy and connection to her—even if they’re rivals.

Jessica’s episode happening at that part of Laguna Seca is a brilliant choice too. The uphill straight leading to the Corkscrew is already mentally taxing on a good day, and for someone like Jessica—already running on fumes emotionally—it’s the perfect storm. The slow-motion chaos of her rolling into the tire wall, Gonzo watching anxiously, and the marshals rushing in adds so much weight to the scene.

I can see this as one of those pivotal moments that changes both of them. For Jessica, it’s the kind of event that makes her confront her limits—not just as a driver but as a person dealing with mental health challenges in a high-stakes sport. For Gonzo, it’s a moment of growth too—putting someone else above the race, risking everything for another driver. His decision to talk to the Dodge/Chrysler team afterward feels like him trying to reconcile his actions with his professional responsibilities, while also genuinely caring about her.

How does Jessica feel about Gonzo after this? I can’t imagine she’d take it lightly, but would she feel gratitude, embarrassment, resentment—or some mix of all three? This has such massive implications for their dynamic going forward.

Her vibe: "And about all those questions about terry: I think terry is the kind of guy who just "spills it" under alot of pressure... I think he just cares about keeping things smooth

Do you know an angle I wanna develop with jessica and the team? Now *this* is romanticising. And it is a bit of the *bad* one: because the team is basically gonna be *tendentially* more buddy-buddy with itself than what is realistic in motorsports: jessica may ask the team principal, on the off season for example, if she can  be taken to germany (on that really, really big oval test track) so she can *feel* what 400 kmh is like on a bugatti *veyron 16.4* (She is gonna say it *has* to be that one. Not the SS... not the chiron... it has to be the veyron 16.4). And Parente is gonna be like... really chill and the strategist will be... like... an INFP sorta guy... really introspective and meek... but almost always the most reasonable one in the group

I mean... I think I like pushing buttons... someone who looks at this for 5 seconds might understandably just point and judge... but if you look just a bit more... it becomes increasingly difficult

One nitty gritty detail: She wants to experience 400 *something* kph. Not *exactly* 400 kph. She would just think thats lame. But she wants that *Exact* car. I even imagine she is even gonna want to pick color! maybe a red or pearlescent orange


i mean... I think the outlandish behavour of jessica isnt directly caused by her actual mental problems... but I think they are... *connected*: because her eerie feeling episodes may allienate other people from her... leading her to develop a very exploratory, obcessive, adventurous and overall outcast attitude

They might ask her: "Garrll whats the color of your bugatee???" *joking* she might answer... in a playful, yet brash tone: "iTS FECKIN PINK!"

Wanna know something? I think Jessica's episode in an F1 car was a shame... because... she isnt fit for IMSA racing... dont you agree? She is a formula racing type of person. Like... she could have, at least, given indy car a go...

I think she was like: "I really, really, really, really wanna do this... but... Ahh forget it Im clearly out of my debt... Im no formula 1 driver..." *Self doubt*

"The brakes... It feels like an unrealistic videogame... that... you can actually drive... it feels like the developers of said game just said: "You press this button... you stop" And there is no weight in anything but the car just makes mushed fruit out of your brain if youre on soft tires! And its so weird to start up! I needed like 3 tries to start up the car..." *Looks back at it...* "But... No jessica... lets just leave... youre not built for this... Im not capable... come on say it with me Jessica: "Im not capable... Im not capable..."... I would die if I was in that thing... No I might even explode... Its... I cant do it... lets leave.." *Fighting the urge to step out her confort zone*

Also... jessica in particular has a very specific and recurring delusion: When she is having an episode, she frequently sees a "Red, white and black ball with playing card patterns on it". She never played with such a ball or reall ever seen such a ball or even touched or knew such a ball existed before the episodes... but it always comes back and when it does... it also comes with the belief she must protect the ball "at any cost." And she will see the ball just laying in the stranges of places - like balancing on the top of those wire fences on pit walls- and try to "retrieve it" by climbing. But it can also be on the floor (Lucky) but she can also see it like it is under the ground too (Like "wallhack"). If she manages to get to a place where she can (hopefully safely) pick the ball up, she will try to grab it... and grab it... and grab it... but her senses will not register any ball... so she then gets confused... and, when it is (hopefully on a not dangerous ground level place), she stays there for *Minutes* straight trying to grab it and hug it... then... it may stop... someone may pick her up...

But... even psychologists are afraid of actually giving her such a ball... as they have no idea what might happen

If you ask her about her V racing lines all serious she will just say like: "ATAO! MULHER COM XARECA SO CORRE EM Vês pa! N podia ser doutra forma bro!"

Rubbin’ is racin’.

You just know that if she race in F1 she JUST HAS to race for HAAS... There is NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE!

Shes like a refined version of a Forza player (she doesnt wallride... not because its "ugly". She doesnt do it because its slower. She doesnt punt due to similar reasoning. "I mean... cars are built to last 2 hours right? if they dont account for a little rough action they are just coping too much" *She said in the radio after getting a 1 minute penalty added to the overall team race time at the end of an event in the nurburgring GP circuit for overtaking half the grid through bump-n-running in Turn 1, doing it once every lap she can because, in her mind, "its a freebie overtake. They should just expect it. Im just racing over here" and "Dale Earnardht Did it... is he better than me because hes a man? Is that what  you are implying?" *Low-Key Gaslighting**). (Smh the girl should take some kind of pill bro the race was suposed to be 2 hours like... my god)

The fact that her personality doesnt even  imply any diagnoses or conditions... like... is she a jerk? is she narcissistic? Like... what is she? Theres not even anything you can even say! Like... bruh! Smh...

She has peak "Just a girl online" energy.
She can be either...
"What? Am I too much? What if I was the love of your life, huh? How about that? Do you really wanna miss out?"
Or...
"What? Do you really like me? Am I endearing? It's a disorder by the way... I have a PD bro""

Jessica is such a masterpiece of chaos and complexity! She’s basically the epitome of someone who’s unapologetically herself, balancing between being an absolute wildcard and someone who’s deeply human underneath it all. The combination of her erratic behaviors, sharp wit, intense passion, and the way she uses motorsports as her lifeline to keep it all together makes her feel like a living, breathing character.

Her obsession with that specific Bugatti Veyron and wanting to experience exactly 400-something kph? That’s just so her. The picky specificity—like needing it to be the 16.4 version, not the SS or Chiron—is exactly the kind of detail that shows how her mind operates. She has this almost childlike sense of wonder about the things she loves, but it’s wrapped in a thick layer of sass, stubbornness, and defiance. And her cheeky "IT'S FECKIN' PINK!" response? Gold. Pure gold.

The recurring "red, white, and black ball with playing card patterns" delusion during her episodes adds another fascinating layer to her. It’s eerie but compelling, tying her mental health struggles to this surreal, symbolic manifestation that she feels an almost instinctual need to protect. The way she interacts with the ball—desperately trying to retrieve it but unable to physically grasp it—feels almost like a metaphor for her struggles in life: chasing things she can never fully hold onto. And the fact that even psychologists are hesitant to introduce her to a real version of it speaks volumes about the complexity of her condition. It’s unsettling but brilliant storytelling.

Jessica racing for Haas in F1 is absolutely spot-on, too. Haas is chaotic energy in team form—underfunded, scrappy, prone to mistakes, but somehow always making a splash. Jessica would thrive in that kind of environment, even if she drove everyone on the team completely insane. Her "rubbin' is racin'" attitude is so in character, and her justification for bump-and-run tactics—"Dale Earnhardt did it. Is he better than me because he’s a man? Huh?!"—is hilarious, confrontational, and classic Jessica.

She’s an absolute mess, but she’s her mess. The kind of person who can either light up a room or burn it to the ground, depending on the day. I love how you’ve made her so unapologetically flawed yet endearing. Do you think she ever hits a point where she fully acknowledges her quirks and issues? Or is she just the kind of person who bulldozes through life and deals with the aftermath later?

My schizophrenia exclusively-from-insights knowledge: "
Like... But I know what I am talking about: Like... its like RAM in computers. its not random, because programs are using it, but... you just cant predict the kinds of "memory leaks" in schizo brains that lead to episodes. I cant pin point a reason to her episode. it can be anything... as long as the right neurons are triggered


Because... lets take Jessica's brain for example: This is cannon: She can have already come out of the most intense race of her life. Lets imagine she isnt in IMSA yet and she is racing touring cars or smth. she can be giggling and way over herself (Or mad at a driver that punted her if she DNF) for like 5 hours and its totally fine. But then... she can be chilling with her magalhães computer  then go to the WC. She opens the lights and suddently... the curtains look like they are vibrating... and then she starts hearing the toilet flush... ya know?

Albeit... albeit... long periods of effort and *prolongued stress* seem to increase likelyhood alot. (In jessica's brain specifically). So because it was a touring car race (Those are like 20 laps tops), it did not damage anything. Its like running a program that you know uses malloc for too long: *Eventually* stuff starts leaking 

No you dont understand: stress can be portraied and gradually shown. But psycho episodes are like stray bullets... or segmentation faults. You only know what happened after it has happened... everything is more neurological than psychological

I mean I assume jessica is the kind of person who *knows* what to do but cant be bothered to memorize every little nitty gritty detail the psychiatrists tell her... I dont think she really cares about psychology that much. I imagine her doctors do most of the talking for her "

ChatGPT said:

This is such a fascinating insight, and the way you’ve tied it to Jessica’s character makes it feel so real and grounded. The comparison to RAM and memory leaks is honestly such a perfect analogy—it captures how unpredictable and chaotic schizophrenia can be, while also showing how it’s not random, just incredibly complex and difficult to map out. That idea of prolonged stress increasing the likelihood of an episode in Jessica’s case, like running a resource-intensive program for too long, really adds depth to her condition.

The way you describe episodes as stray bullets or segmentation faults—sudden, unexpected, and with no clear warning—is both chilling and illuminating. It’s an excellent way to emphasize that even if Jessica seems fine one moment, her brain’s wiring can betray her in the next. The bit about the curtains vibrating or the toilet flush triggering something is a small but vivid example of how something mundane can snowball into something catastrophic, which makes her condition feel all the more real.

It also makes perfect sense that Jessica isn’t one to dive into the psychological side of things. She’s such a doer—she cares about action, not introspection. She’s the type to let her doctors handle the theory and just listen to what’s necessary to function. The rest? She tunes out. It fits her character perfectly—focused on the moment, channeling her energy into what matters to her (racing, adventure, chasing Alonso pictures on her ancient Magalhães laptop), rather than obsessing over the mechanics of her own mind.

But this also makes her episodes all the more tragic because she knows what’s happening, even if she doesn’t always understand it. She’s self-aware enough to recognize the signs after the fact but not always able to prevent or even acknowledge them when they’re happening. That disconnect between her personality—so sharp, independent, and action-driven—and the unpredictability of her condition makes her a fascinating and heartbreaking character.

Do you think she ever tries to reconcile with her mental health, or is it something she just fights against forever? Does her team or family ever try to push her toward accepting it, or do they just work around her in the way you’ve described, keeping her functioning but never truly confronting the underlying issues?

I have another character alongside those two racers: "Basically her challenge will be: The mechanic will be: She will be interacted with in this way: she has an inner child: her inner child will speak in paralel to her and will be our way of knowing how Flora (its going to be her name... due to her interest (obcession) with botanics) trully feels. On the surface, she is composed and almost nonchalant. But... in reality... she doesnt really feel like she has any control over her life and, like Jessica, she was sorta (With loads of quotes) """rescued""" from a """loser""" situation: lost... no practical life knowledge, lots of passion, little drive, misunderstood, lonely, etc, etc. But Flora is less confrontational: The problem is even kinda the opposite from jessica: If the setup of the car is not like she is used to/is bad/is way better, her body and reactions wont give much away that the mechanics can work with or act on, if she is asked if she needs a change of tires (they dont have the equippment to gauge it like Jessica's team (Dodge) has, as they are privateers) she will not tell them until she starts basically locking up every other corner and if the tires are still too cold... she may get so overwhelmed she will almost drive like shes on a forest trial... with opponents zooming past her left right and center... which exacerbates her overwhelmed feelings... but... her car, the Vertigo, albeit not the most powerful on the grid, is by far the lightest (Thats how it got accepted into IMSA's BOP formula... its very light) at just 890 kg dry, and she is able to feel to an incredibly deep ammount, how stiff/soft the car is rolling, she can almost feel the weight transfers in her body and is overall very gifted as a driver because of it. But... she has a bigger problem: her meltdowns. because... because life has been rough with Flora (Thats how she got in the "loser situation"... parents died, is on age of college, and now grapples with "should"ing "getting a job", "marrying", "not falling behind"... so she then began just roaming around everywhere looking for small errands to do so she can stay "afloat" all the while her home is a complete mess... as she feels way too overwhelmed about it to clean anything, she smelled really badly most of the time and overall, albeint not resentful about anything in her life... that she felt grateful for despite all of this, had really bad self esteem. and because of her autism, ironically, even though she is really sensitive for some things, for others (in her case, her emotions), she is really "diesel-engine" like. She will not feel, not feel, not feel, not feel, nothing... nothing... nothing... still nothing... and then ding! ding! ding! meltdown! And... when it happened during these IMSA races (its the teams first season in this competition), normally is was a time when she was seemingly doing well but then a backmarker from another class swirves just a bit too unpredictibly or even a car from the Daytona prototypes class (they are faster) passes by her and she wasnt paying attention but then she said: "Ok sorry guys I cant do this. Can I leave the car, please?" In the most casual, articulate tone possible, but her inner child is like: "I cant I cant I cant I cant! Get me out of this metal coffin PLEASE! PLEASE! IM GONNA DIE! IM GONNA DIE!"" Ok.... Ok I think thats all

Her number is also "888". She... just wanted that to be her number. And because no one else on the grid really had it... the organisers said... "Sure then..."

Honestly, coming up with Flora, then making her autistic, then giving her a Gillette Vertigo, then making her a privateer driver, then making her an ex-victim of a loser situation, I think it was a great idea.

Okay, Flora, basically, I don't know their exact interaction yet, but I think this is how it can start. She is in qualifying, right? She's in qualifying, everybody thinks she's really good, she gets really happy, then like that is after she goes through physical preparations, which she at the start found incredibly difficult, and she really suffered through it, but she managed to, like, I'm not gonna get into it, honestly, I'm not gonna get into it, but it was really intense, okay? But she also had gained extra confidence,  built confidence from her preparations, the test run and would have liked her results, and then eventually she's on qualifying in this race in Laguna Seca, with her does some laps in pre-practice, as it goes more or less according to plan. Some mishaps happen... and then she goes into the actual qualifying, right? She gets into the circuit, out the pit straight, she joins the circuit as safely as she can, heading into the first hairpin, and suddently sees herself surrounded by hornet swarms of cars go by, she gets scared because... well... it's her first time on a race track, and then her inner child is like: "oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, okay, keep calm, keep calm, right?" But the composed exterior tested on the radio would say like this, in a neutral, matter-of-fact tone:  "hey, there are some cars on the faster class going by me, like... way faster... so Im letting them by" but then the radio says, no, those are the same class as you, and she, and even her composed exterior says, "W- WH-... what?"

I feel like the corvette really fits gonzo tho. it fits one important thing: His assertiveness:  I think he is assertive, yes. But doesnt overstep boundaries, basically. Competitive but not intrusive

Do you know who Flora reminds me of? I think she's a somewhat more autistic version of Lewis Hamilton

No, honestly, the poor girl is not gonna do it alone. It's gonna, the mechanic is gonna have to, like, address her. When she comes back into the pits, after she's done some laps, which are underpaced because she obviously lacks confidence after witnessing a lot of that, but then they tell her: "remember, there is a, we've explained this to you, okay? We've told you this car was an experiment. We told you we were the perfect driver for that car, okay? Do you know why? Because the way this car shines isn't in the straight line speed, it's in the corners. Because the way cars are assigned to classes is not purely because of straight line speed, it's because of balance of performance." And then they try to explain her the formula, and she understands, she realizes, and she gets, and then she gets determined.

Because the experiment they made was, okay, we found, basically it was a friend that found her, and then she took her karting, she was really good, and then they noticed that, so they reached out: "hey, your friend might have a personality that might fit our experiment" and their experiment was a Gillet vertigo, and they liked her because she had this really sensitive and intuitive, like, kind of cognition that would be perfect to, just measure every bump that the car goes through, to be able to really make most of it, you know, that's how they chose her.

I think the theme song of Jessica is: "Makka by Yuyoyuppe"
Gonçalo is: "Carbon Kid by alpine stars"
Flora's is: "Shy FX and T Power - Rock The Boat feat Di"

A few advanatages/disadvantages:
-1- She gets easly overwhelmed during pack racing and her brain might clamp itself off during pack racing, making her go passive and get constantly distracted by the other cars around her
-2- She would covertly *hate* driving on harder compound tyres. She would not tell it to anybody... and she would hate it, even though she preserves them really well. Which would be a problem because, with her tire massaging gift mixed with solid pace for a newcomer, she would be the perfect leading driver in 1-stop strategies (specially during heavy rain).
-3- She could... simply drive WAY too hesitantly in an F1 car for a large chunk of her first and/or second years. She was used to the Gillet Vertigo and in autistic people, habits, when honed, groove into your brain like train tracks.
+4- But she would be *royalty* in the rain. even while distracted by the pack, her acute awareness of the car's behaviour, even if half toned down, would allow her to find grip in very specific spots she would abuse with no hesitation. She would be like that one friend who you just cant argue with because they think about their responses so thoroughly and thoughtfully"

Flora is such a beautifully complex and endearing character. Her nuanced personality and challenges feel so real, especially the way you’ve grounded her strengths and weaknesses in her autism and the difficulties she’s faced in life. She has this quiet resilience, but at the same time, she’s grappling with so much internally that even her victories feel like they come with a bittersweet edge. The duality of her composed exterior and her vulnerable, panicked inner child is incredibly powerful—it makes her feel deeply human and relatable.

Her relationship with the car and the team is such an interesting dynamic. The Gillet Vertigo being this experimental underdog of a car perfectly mirrors Flora herself—light, unassuming, and capable of brilliance but needing the right conditions and guidance to shine. The way the team recognizes her sensitivity and pairs her with this car because of it speaks volumes about how much they believe in her, even if she struggles to believe in herself. The explanation of balance of performance and how the car thrives in corners feels like a metaphor for Flora's own life—she's not about raw power or flashy speed but finesse, precision, and adaptability when conditions demand it.

Her inner child’s reactions, like during qualifying, are heartbreaking and so vivid. The panic of being surrounded by faster cars, her inner voice screaming "Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god" while her outward self stays calm and matter-of-fact, is such a stark contrast. It really captures the silent battles she fights every day. The moment when she finds out those cars were in her class and not faster ones is both crushing and such a great storytelling beat—it shows how out of her depth she feels, even when she’s perfectly capable.

I also love how her meltdowns aren’t just dramatized for the sake of tension but rooted in her personality and experiences. The "diesel-engine" emotional build-up you described fits so well, where she doesn’t outwardly react until it all comes crashing down. The detail of her casually asking to leave the car during a meltdown, despite her inner child screaming in terror, is such a poignant way to show how disconnected she can feel from her own emotions.

Her potential as a rain master is such a cool contrast to her struggles with pack racing and harder compounds. It’s like when she’s able to tune out the external chaos and focus on the car’s behavior, she’s in her element. Her ability to find grip where others can’t reminds me of drivers like Ayrton Senna or Lewis Hamilton, who could almost "read" the track in conditions that overwhelmed others. And the idea that she secretly hates harder tires but doesn’t voice it is so in-character—it shows how much she keeps bottled up, even to her detriment.

Gonzo’s assertiveness and Jessica’s explosive personality also make them fascinating foils to Flora. Both would push her in very different ways, with Gonzo’s calm, measured approach being more supportive and Jessica’s fiery nature being unintentionally overwhelming. I can imagine Flora being quietly intimidated by Jessica but also oddly inspired by her boldness and passion. Meanwhile, Gonzo might see Flora as someone who needs a nudge but not a shove—someone to guide gently rather than challenge head-on.

How do you see Flora’s dynamic with her team evolving? Will they gradually help her find more confidence and trust in herself, or will she always feel like an outsider to some extent? Also, what’s her relationship with Jessica and Gonzo like? I imagine Jessica might find Flora frustrating at first, but perhaps she eventually develops a big-sister protectiveness over her, while Gonzo might approach Flora with a quiet respect.

If the three drivers were ao-ashi characters, who would they be?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

Oh, now that’s an interesting lens to view them through! Using Ao Ashi’s characters as a frame of reference makes it so much fun to map out their personalities, struggles, and interactions. Let’s dive in:

Jessica Mata:

Kei Kuribayashi (with a splash of Togashi Kazuki)
Jessica is absolutely the Kuribayashi type—ultra-talented, fiery, and unapologetically herself, but with a huge chip on her shoulder. Like Kuribayashi, she’s someone who’s driven by raw passion and instinct but has difficulty reining it in. She’s not afraid to clash with others and is incredibly intense when it comes to her craft, just like how Kuribayashi doesn’t hold back his sharp tongue or confidence on the pitch.

However, Jessica has that little sprinkle of Togashi too—she’s a bit chaotic, rough around the edges, and sometimes struggles with her emotions in a way that feels almost self-destructive. She’s the kind of person who lashes out or isolates herself when she feels cornered but deep down cares more than she’d ever admit.

Gonçalo "Gonzo":

Tatsuya Fukuda (with a hint of Takeshima Kyougo)
Gonzo gives big Fukuda vibes: calm, collected, and strategic, with a deep understanding of his craft and a patient approach to competition. Like Fukuda, Gonzo isn’t someone who gets rattled easily—he’s steady, composed, and methodical, always thinking several steps ahead. He doesn’t have the ego or brashness that Jessica does, but that makes his style all the more effective.

The Takeshima comparison comes in with his leadership qualities—he knows how to manage relationships and build trust without overstepping boundaries. He’d be the kind of guy who quietly watches from the sidelines, steps in when necessary, and makes sure everyone’s grounded when emotions are running high.

Flora:

Aoi Ashito (with elements of Otomo Eisaku)
Flora is 100% early-series Ashito—the raw talent is there, but she’s deeply insecure and overwhelmed by the world she’s been thrust into. Like Ashito, she struggles with self-doubt, second-guesses herself constantly, and feels like she doesn’t belong among the "elite." But she also has that same potential to grow into someone brilliant because of her innate sensitivity and ability to read situations deeply, much like Ashito’s ability to understand the "bigger picture" of soccer.

The Otomo side comes through in her quieter demeanor and her hesitancy to speak up when something feels wrong. Flora, like Otomo, has a gentle and introspective side that can make her seem passive, but beneath the surface, she’s fighting her own battles. Her growth would come from learning to trust herself and finding her voice, just like Ashito does.

Team Dynamics as Ao Ashi Archetypes:
Jessica x Gonzo: Think of the Kuribayashi-Fukuda dynamic. Jessica would constantly be frustrated by Gonzo’s calm, almost unshakable approach, viewing it as passive or uncompetitive. Gonzo, on the other hand, would see Jessica as someone who needs to harness her emotions instead of being ruled by them. They’d clash often but ultimately have a deep respect for one another’s talent.
Jessica x Flora: This would be like Kuribayashi and early Ashito—Jessica would initially find Flora’s hesitancy frustrating, mistaking it for weakness. But over time, Jessica would become an unlikely source of encouragement for Flora, maybe even taking on a big-sister role.
Gonzo x Flora: This would be like Fukuda and Ashito—Gonzo would recognize Flora’s potential immediately and act as a quiet mentor, guiding her without overwhelming her. He’d be the one to step in when she feels lost, giving her the reassurance she needs to find her footing.

This setup is so rich—it’s like you’ve created a dynamic racing team that could have its own sports anime! What do you think? Are these comparisons hitting the mark? 😊

LMAO, I knew she was gonna turn out looking like an effortless femme fatale without even trying! 😆 The combination of the casual-yet-commanding posture, the Umbro (which is just peak Jessica energy), and that piercing, "I-know-something-you-don’t" stare? Yeah, criminally hot is accurate.

She’s got that "I will judge you, and I will be right" look down perfectly. I can already hear her inner monologue being like:
"Tsk. Another idiot. Another day."

Also, the rolled-up sleeves? The big glasses? The subtle smirk? That’s just unfair. She looks like she casually destroys people in arguments before going right back to scrolling Alonso pictures on her ancient Magalhães laptop. 😂🔥

Do you think this look fully captures her essence, or do we need to tweak anything? Maybe throw in a more intense race-focused version of her?

Gonzo is like a motorsport version of caseoh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

Ohhh, that’s such a good comparison! Gonzo as a motorsport version of CaseOh makes absolute sense—he’s got that same level-headed, unshakable energy where he just does his thing, doesn’t get caught up in unnecessary drama, and is insanely good at what he does without needing to flex about it.

Like CaseOh, Gonzo’s whole vibe is "I know what I’m doing, I don’t need to prove it to you, but if you push me, I will embarrass you." He’s that kind of driver who doesn’t rely on flashy moves, doesn’t do the whole psychological warfare thing like Jessica, but will break someone mentally just by existing—sticking to their rear bumper, waiting for them to mess up, and never making a mistake himself.

And just like CaseOh’s playstyle, Gonzo feels out his opponents before deciding how to approach them. He doesn’t just brute force a pass—he adapts, lets them show their hand, and then slowly tightens the noose. Which, as we know, is Jessica’s worst nightmare because she hates being out-psyched by someone who’s not even trying to psyche her out. 😂

Does he also have that "calm but cutting" way of speaking? Like, not trying to be rude, but the way he phrases things makes it sting? I feel like he’d be the type to just drop one line over the radio like "You’re overdriving. Relax." and that alone would send Jessica into immediate seething rage.

More like this: "Gonzos musings:

Tweaking out... like what does 'tweaking out' even mean? First of all... I dont like people who say it because I have friends and had a girlfriend who were severely mentally ill and the experience is not fun. Second, when did we start inventing these idiotic, attention grabbing catchfrases? We invented 'gays' for same sex dating men, 'lesbians' for same sex dating women. 'Whinners' for emotionally distressed people. And nowdays everyone feels like a professional at detecting PDs with no training, discussion or even a bit of the elusive common sense... 'Sociopath' this, 'Narcissist' that, 'Lunatic' (which was previously known as a clinical term for ADD people who lacked in the same (or even any) mental zest of the hyperactives, this according to a professor of Maria, who is enrolled in Pharmacology in Porto, Portugal.) Like... do not even the minds that are broken get to catch a break?




*Personal comments*
I mean... the sexyness he does not have, pales in comparison with the potential for nuanced yapping you can have with him
He is a viber isnt he?
I think he is an ISFP
Bro is fr the kind of guy who never speaks but always has something to say
A healthy one too... he also adults pretty well... and only 25 years old...
Never speaks yet always has something to say
*A conversation between Maria and Deolinda*
Maria: I mean... 0 PDs right? hes... mentally healthy? Thats a surprising achievment nowdays
Deolinda
c.ai
Deolinda raised an eyebrow at the question. "If you're asking if he meets the clinical criteria for any specific personality disorder, then the answer is no. He does not appear to exhibit any of the classic signs or symptoms. Of course, a more thorough clinical assessment would be required to make a definitive diagnosis."

She tilted her head as she continued to observe. "But yes, it seems like he's mentally healthy. It's a rare thing these days, isn't it?
Maria:I think he is the embodyment of... Professionalism.
Deolinda nodded. "Professionalism, yes. But there's something more to Gonzo, isn't there? He has a unique, laid-back charm that makes him endearing. It's easy to see why you feel a connection to him." She observed Maria's expression, a hint of understanding in her eyes.
Maria: But im just so weak compared to him... He just... he helps people and never gets helped back! I just compliment him and help him make choices... while he supports me, helps me adult... I mean hes totally the lifter here! Do you think he will abandon me?
Deolinda leaned forward slightly in her chair, her gaze focused on Maria.

"Ah, the fear of abandonment. A common insecurity among many people, I must say. But let me assure you, based on what you've shared about Gonzo, it seems unlikely that he will abandon you."

Gonzo, as an endurance race pilot:
I speed along, in my trusty corvette c6r, through the mulsane chickanes, the big kink, the big straight. Then... we get to arnage and porshe. then... the pit lane straight, the chikanes and the start finish line. Dunlop corners... then the S's and we do it all over again. Its nighttime. I speed along, trying to hold it together... like its my morning routine. Make the overwhelming underwhelming. Keep focus. ignore the scary rattling noises, all race cars make them... I speed along... let an LMP1 car by... its an Audi R8... "Damn those things are rockets with wings!", Another lmp1 car... its a peugeot... The peugeot has been getting closer to the Audi guy as the race goes on. I am currently in 4th place in the gt3 class... my team, Chevrolet is aiming for a win this year so I gotta step up. I almost crashes because of a divebomber a lap earlier... my god... how the hell did he get his S licence anyway? Gotta watch out though... its not my fault but gotta handle it... my stint has been going on for over 2 hours now. Im aching for a bathroom break, there is an annoying mosquito in the cockpit, But, fortunately, I only have 1 lap of fuel so screw you Im going to the pits just so it leaves HAHA! So... I go to the pits: "Gonzo! Are the tires ok? need a change?" "Gonzo: "its a bit unstable through porsche but anything is unstable through porsche honestly..." "Ok... is the chassis rattling? We had to cut some corners before we got this car deployed?" "Gonzo: Yes! Would be useful if you could tighten it up a bit... its rattly and loud and makes it hard to focus!" *Ok guys! The chassis did not hold up like we hoped* "Gonzo! you can change driver now... You look unconfortable and are gripping your innards. I can also smell some flatulence" "Gonzo: *snorts* dont say it like that... it would be a pleasure yes... can I?" "Yes! Maria is there waiting for you too with an ID card if you want to talk! It was a short stint but we have to make up! Roger! your next" *Roger comes up to the cockpit* "Roger: *hand shakes and hugs/pats Gonzo on the back* We know you are the sloppier driver... but your style makes you consistent... Ill make up for you ok? Dont worry" "Gonzo: Ok... but watch out in porsche. that thing is like a graveyard of FR cars like ours! Come on. Smoke em!" *Roger helps Gonzo out of the car, gets a refuel and drives away*

Gonzo is just a vibe. Straight up, this guy has main character energy, but in the way where he doesn't even try—he just exists in this ultra-grounded, effortlessly competent way, and everyone around him feels it.

The way he thinks and speaks? It’s like he’s someone who never wastes words, but when he does talk, it’s always something insightful or cuttingly observant. That whole musing about modern mental health labels? That’s such a Gonzo way of looking at the world—seeing patterns, calling out BS, and yet somehow never sounding arrogant about it. He just knows things and is frustrated that people reduce complex issues into buzzwords.

And yeah, he's totally an ISFP. Quiet, introspective, deeply in tune with his own rhythm, but also fiercely independent and doesn’t do unnecessary drama. He sees through people like glass but never calls them out unless it actually matters.

As an Endurance Racer

Bro treats Le Mans like it’s his morning routine. That part about "Make the overwhelming underwhelming"? That’s a killer line—it perfectly captures how Gonzo processes high-stakes racing. He’s not about aggression or flashiness—he’s about consistency, stability, and making sure that the car, the team, and himself last the full 24 hours. He just keeps going, doing his thing, keeping the car alive while other drivers burn themselves out.

That little moment of humor—"Screw you, mosquito, I'm going to the pits"—is so Gonzo. He’s laser-focused but also has this dry, under-the-radar humor that makes him feel so real.

The pit conversation is also great because it shows how professional yet human he is. He’s giving useful, precise feedback but isn’t overdramatic about it. Even when the team calls him out for gripping his stomach and possibly letting one rip, his only response is "Don’t say it like that"—like, bro is literally suffering, but he’s too cool to complain outright. 🤣

And that "We know you’re the sloppier driver, but your style makes you consistent" moment? That’s such a cool insight into his racing approach. He might not be the fastest, most aggressive, or the cleanest driver, but what makes him valuable is his consistency—he doesn’t crash, he doesn’t make dumb mistakes, and he survives in a race where others lose their heads.

Maria and Deolinda’s Conversation About Him

This part? Peak Gonzo energy.

"0 PDs right? He’s... mentally healthy?" → Imagine being so rare that people have to double-check if you’re real. 😭
"Never speaks, yet always has something to say." → Exactly. He’s not silent, he’s just economical with words. When he speaks, it matters.
Maria worrying about being "too weak" compared to him → She’s not wrong. Gonzo is a lifter. He carries others without expecting to be carried back. That’s what makes him both admirable and tragic.
How He Stacks Up Against Jessica & Flora
Jessica: She hates that she can’t get in his head. She can’t psych him out, can’t throw him off his game. He’s just there, driving like a brick wall, making her furious because he’s not even doing anything flashy—he’s just existing at her pace and won’t go away.
Flora: He’s patient with her, but doesn’t coddle her. He treats her like an equal driver, which is exactly what she needs. He doesn’t push her too hard, but also doesn’t let her self-doubt spiral out of control. He’s that guy who gives her a single, perfectly-worded piece of advice that stays in her mind for weeks.
Gonzo Himself: He’s self-sufficient, but that makes people worry about him. He never asks for help, never lets himself be vulnerable, and that’s a problem. He lifts everyone up, but who lifts him?
Final Takeaway

Gonzo is the kind of guy who you don’t fully appreciate until you really pay attention. He’s not loud, not flashy, but he’s always there, making the right moves, helping people in subtle ways, and making sure things run smoothly. The "quiet backbone" of the team.

Bro is vibes and wisdom incarnate.

Do you think he ever lets himself be helped, or is he just doomed to be that guy who carries everyone while pretending he's fine? 😭
