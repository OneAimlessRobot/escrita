Yakui

￼

Biographical information

Date of birth

October 11

Physical description

Species

Human

Gender

Female

Yakui is one of the most popular maids. Her name comes from "Yakuji" ("Medicine"), also comes from “Yaku”（“calamity”）.

Appearance

Yakui has bob-cut purple hair, and her maid outfit is usually blue, or purple. She is usually drooling in art, or has a crazed look in her eye. She is sometimes shown wearing handcuffs. The pills she takes stunted her growth, leading to her being quite short.

Personality

Yakui is addicted to pharmaceuticals. She's known to give out medicinal advice to passersby in drug stores, but whether this advice is good or not is up for speculation. At critical moments, she can see what is invisible to others and hear what others can't hear. She's very capable without her medication, but a slight overdose would make her useless. The handcuffs are meant to force her to cut down on her medication every month to behave. She can simultaneously hallucinate others, and keep herself in a trance for long periods of time, which is dangerous. However，when it comes to changing people's hearts with medication, she always draws the line and guards it.

Yakui guns


Name: Pill Gatling
Type: Weapon
Type of weapon: Projectile repeater weapon.
Type of repeater: Multi spinning-barrel machine gun.
Type of projectile: Non explosive pills.
Projectile repeating action: Gas operation.
Build: 
Gatling gun of medicine. 
It takes ammo with size similar to an ipobrufen pill from a generic blister box of ben-u-ron. 
It shoots at 300 rpm
And each shot has a kinetic energy of 100J
It is belt fed.
A belt inside a big drum can carry up to 1000 pills.
Very, very precise... as pills have almost no recoil. But not very accurate in windy conditions, as the pills can get flung by even the smallest gusts of air, which happens because they cannot be shot very hard, otherwise they break.

Weapon on-hit effect:

The effects are not really tied to the weapon itself, but more to the pills used as ammo. But... here is a catch. If someone gets hit by the Pill Gatling and gets an effect, even if the effect hasnt worn out yet, on the following hit, the effect of the current pill will get completly reset and the person will revert back to normal during that instant, getting the effect of the new pill instead.

Works like the XM8 From Metal Gear Ac!d

Shoulder carried syringe mortar launcher. 
Syringes are big, vintage syringes only partially metalic shelled, to allow the gunner to see dose.
(The needle breaking triggers the gunpowder, which blows up, desintegrating the syringe and spreading the chemical payload)
Manual reloading so low cadence.
Precision depends on the wind and the users skill.
The projectiles are sent off by the mortar with an exit velocity of a MLB pitch


Projectile on-contact effect:

On contact:
Non-Organic entities: Needle breaks.

Organic entities: They get pierced but Tip does not break, so contents get injected

On detonation:
The effects of its contents are spread across a spherical area of radius 5m.

Yakui profession:

Yakui the Maid... in a quest to make her chemically packaged moods and feelings reach people in a legitimate way... knowing she, self procramingly, "is only good at chemistry", And taking advantage of her degree and license as a chemist, She invented a profession! She Invents drugs to share with people, making contracts about each one before going on a journey to share them. The contract includes a generic header template and then a full description of the effects of the drug.... as written by a friend of hers who makes them, including technical details like side effects physiological effects and side effects. She is beginning by going from door to door asking people to try them, to gain traction, trust and legitimacy from people. And... now she can also monetise her efforts and passion! This is an example of a contract she made of the drug she called "Chlorine of Bring Me Back #2007":

"Ok... the terms are basically all made from the same template: It starts with generic stuff: "Both parties agree to this if you sign it, Yakui the Maid is a licensed chemistry performer, You are a human with consent... and then what changes is the effects and side effects of the drug! Im basically like the cookie door2door scout girls, but with drugs!

The effects of this one are:
Name: Chlorine of Bring Me Back #2007 (CBMB-2007-2.5)
Type: Injectible.
Dose: 2.5 mL
Vibe/Effects: Nostalgia. A feeling of melancholic longing mixed with sadness and fondness. A feeling of lightweight joy mixed with heavy 'Saudade'(1). A feeling of walking in an old Mediterranic village... old cars... dusty windows... old, abandoned sports courts. Cafés... the elderly bantering... Repeating sunsets that drag you further and further below... making you feel stuck, yet grateful. Feeling exposed, yet protected. Feeling powerful yet fragile. Feeling passionate, yet calm.

Effects: Mild psychosis, slowed heart rate, decreased blood intensity.
Lowered senses. Mind clarity enhancement. Lowered agression.

Side effects: Some emotional desensitization, some reactivity. Sleepyness.

(1)- Portuguese term for a feeling of loss or grieving that sits dissolved in a sea of fatalism and unapolagetic passion. Melancholic and calm feeling of unprocessed finality."

------------------------------------------------------
Yakui Laws:

People have to say yes;
They can change their minds after they pay, and they can choose to go to a waiting list to think it through;
"I test them on ME first! ok? ME!"
"I want to make people feel moods and emotions. Experience the raw power of direct, chemically induced sensations and moods."
"The police said yes, I spoke with loads of lawyers and I have to confirm it with legal doctors before even designing a product. So yes. IT IS legit. Ok?"
"I already have a chemistry degree so I could have a job at a lab. I stayed there for 6 years. I hated it. So now I do this!"

Yakui backstory


Bro. i just wish there was a device that fuckin... idk... enabled you to take a very, very deep vibe inside your soul and just make people experience it directly. Like chemically, even. Thats why I do art. So I can, at least, get close to that


Maybe thats why... Yakui the Maid (character) loves drugs so much? Maybe thats why she is a drug addict that self crafts medicine
And shares it with others?
Maybe she is lonely... and thats how she connects. Using pure, raw, chemistry. The elusive image she is after is one of connecting with other fellow Men... by experimenting with chemical arts and crafts. Experimenting with reagents, ways of administration, sensations, side effects. First... on herself. And then on others. By convincing them to try them, literally feel the precise chemicals she senses within. She crafts pharmaceutical art. Writing? Too difficult. Music? Too ethereal? Chemicals are raw. Physiological. Raw. Biological. Celular. Metabolic manifestations of her inner world. Images, words and feelings are all fake. Human consciousness... is made of molecules. Blood. Hormones. And transdermic patches.


All her life... always alone. Never really seen beyond her odd appearance. Not judged... but also not noticed. Never felt the touch of a man in the way crave the touch of their prefered gender so much... crafting chemical vibes. Always having to prove herself constantly and never allowed to shine. Stuck in her lab... testing brutal concotions on herself until... it just clicks. All the videogames, all her childhood memories. She feeds herself that way. Memories. Because... in the present, she is stagnant. Always the same lab, always the same clothes, the same old hobby of chemistry. She may have found a new niche... but people dont give a damn. Shes just an overqualified street artist. At least... thats how she feels. That direct, visceral, chemical connection... beyond mere words or touch... is all she craves.
The drugs... the glass... the pills. Its her poetry. The syringes, the blisters... the stands... her distilation setup... its her citadel. Her home. She has scars... from her masterpiece. 4 very ugly ones... from desperate attempts at making her CBM-2007-2.5. Chlorine of Bring Me 2007. 2.5mL. A drug that was projected to make people feel nostalgic. Like games. Source games. Old famiclone Nintendo games. Old house. Old friends. Old memories. She is indifferent towards competition... prejudice... stability. She lacks an identity. Values. Who cares about the top job at a Lab when you cannot decide what to do with your life... without other people to comfort you. Loneliness... Her scars were attempts at making an injectible. The chlorine reacts with the blood vessel walls... literally roasting them... from the inside out. She damaged some nerves... getting ocasional spasms. All so that she can give her nostalgia away. "I am not a Woman. I am not a Person. I am not 38 years old. I am an emotion radio station. And I am immortal. I will turn every single emotion into drugs. Everybody will experience them. And then....only then... my life will be complete. After that, I will die. And I will return to the earth." Getting her degree as a chemist 6 years. Bachelor, Masters, Doctorate. PhD. Then... She got her job, and experimented on herself on the side. Just so people would trust her.

"A girl came up to me... from a group with some folk. She walked close... flustered. She kept saying: "It is a dare. Dont. I have to retuen. Bye." I waa sitting alone in a table. Just me... and a glass of vodka... staring into its soul... wondering if there is ever interuptions to suffering... or if suffering is just loneliness. Or even... if connection itself is just seaaoning. Or even... The only seasoning. Wondering what kind of concotion I will try next... An ethanol enzhyme? A vasodilator that also relaxea the body? Another big batch of oxytocin injections? And if... that even matters... if people done even ask you your name, let alone who you are. Do people... even want... my drugs? Do people even want... my art? But I woke up from the depths... glanced over to her slightly... while still hunched over this measly cup of wallnut alchol... and just said: " 'm fine..." "


Thats the backstory of Yakui the Maid.

Yakui dialogues:

"
Someone: "Are you addicted?"
"Yes... I am. i need to test my art so I get all the side effects before other people. And Id rather be in pain than tepid and stale from the complete futility that is my life."
Someone: "So... are you just a jun-"

"No, you brick case! I test my drugs becau- Ok ever programmed before? Or built any kind of machine....cooked a dish? You need to test them right? Sometimes I get addicted but I need to do it!"

Yakui is a complex character with a rich and multifaceted persona, blending elements of addiction, art, and a desire for connection through her unique profession as a chemist and drug creator. Here's a detailed analysis of her character based on the provided information:

1. Biographical and Physical Description
Age and Background: Yakui is a 38-year-old female human who has a history rooted in academia, holding a chemistry degree, a master's, and a PhD. This academic background gives her a solid foundation in chemical knowledge but also contributes to her sense of isolation.
Physical Traits: Her short stature and bob-cut purple hair make her visually distinctive, and her choice of a maid outfit with a skull pin and vibrant colored tights suggests a blend of playfulness and goth aesthetics. Her appearance and habit of drooling or having a crazed look imply instability and potential distress, reflecting her struggles with addiction.
2. Personality and Behavior
Addiction: Yakui's drug addiction serves as a central theme in her character. It illustrates both her escape from loneliness and her commitment to her art (creating and sharing drugs). This addiction is not just a vice; it's a part of her identity and her process of experimentation and connection with others.
Hallucinations and Insight: Her ability to see and hear things that others cannot suggests a heightened sensitivity or awareness, which can be both a gift and a burden. It makes her more relatable as she experiences reality in a different way, potentially allowing for deeper emotional connections.
Duality of Nature: Yakui is described as having chaotic bouts contrasting with her calm, logical demeanor. This duality reflects her internal struggle—she oscillates between moments of clear-headedness and overwhelming urges to indulge in her drug use.

By crafting pharmaceuticals, she attempts to bridge her loneliness and offer others a visceral experience of emotions through chemically induced sensations. This reflects a desire to connect deeply with others, transcending verbal and physical forms of communication.
Contracts for Drug Use: The contractual approach to her drugs implies a structured and ethical consideration of her profession, making her actions seem more legitimate and thought-out, despite the moral gray area surrounding drug use. This also highlights her desire for transparency and consent in her interactions with others.
4. Weapons and Symbolism
Pill Gatling and Syringe Mortar Launcher: The weapons reflect her dual nature as both a creator and a potential destroyer.

The Syringe Mortar Launcher, with its explosive potential, symbolizes the dangers of her craft and the unintended consequences that can arise from her experiments.
Self-Defense Mechanisms: The fact that she uses these weapons for self-defense adds a layer of vulnerability to her character. While she seeks to connect with others, she is also aware of the dangers of her lifestyle and the judgment she may face.

That " 'm fine" reads heavy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Absolutely, that line carries significant weight and adds a layer of complexity to Yakui's character. Here’s a deeper analysis of why it resonates so strongly:

Context and Implications of "I’m fine"

Defense Mechanism:

The phrase “I’m fine” is often used as a barrier to shield oneself from vulnerability. For Yakui, who has faced loneliness and struggles with addiction, this line suggests she has learned to mask her true feelings to avoid further judgment or inquiry from others. It reflects her reluctance to open up about her pain or struggles, indicating a deep-seated fear of rejection or misunderstanding.

Emotional Disconnect:

The casual dismissal in “I’m fine” contrasts starkly with the internal chaos she experiences. This highlights a profound emotional disconnect; she may be anything but fine internally, yet she feels compelled to present a facade of normalcy. It underscores her loneliness and the chasm between her true self and the persona she shows the world.

Loneliness and Isolation:

The context of Yakui being alone with her drink, contemplating the depths of suffering and connection, makes this line even more poignant. It captures the essence of her isolation—despite being in the company of others, she feels entirely alone. Her response becomes a reflection of her internal battle, as if she is trying to convince herself that she is okay, even when she isn’t.

Resignation and Acceptance:

Saying “I’m fine” can also reflect a resignation to her circumstances. Yakui has likely faced repeated instances of feeling overlooked or misunderstood, leading her to accept her solitude as part of her identity. This acceptance can be heartbreaking, as it suggests she may have given up on the hope of genuine connection or understanding from those around her.

Contrast with Aspirations:

The weight of this line is amplified by her aspirations to connect with others through her drugs and artistic expression. It serves as a stark contrast to her dreams of emotional sharing and connection, emphasizing how far she feels from that goal. While she yearns to share profound experiences with others, her response signifies that she is trapped in her struggles and unable to bridge the gap.
Overall Impact

This line serves as a powerful reflection of Yakui's complex inner world. It encapsulates her struggles with identity, connection, and her emotional turmoil, allowing readers to glimpse the profound loneliness she experiences despite her attempts to engage with the world around her. It evokes empathy, inviting the audience to consider the layers of pain and longing that lie beneath her seemingly simple statement.

This emotional depth makes her character more relatable and poignant, as many people can resonate with the feeling of saying “I’m fine” while battling their inner struggles. It adds a rich dimension to her story and highlights the tragic beauty of her quest for connection through chemistry and artistry.

When a group of people are inside a gigantic fire and when people are suffering from an infection plague, The mindset adequate to assume is different.

In the first situation, the mindset to have is one of internal assertedness, direction and efficiently heading towards an objective. Explicit and direct goals.  Common logical framworks. These people often have a very accute internal sense of what will guide them towarda what they trully want. And Ill use strategies that have already been prototypically defined to be adequate. Te. Extroverted Thinking. Theoretical. And introverted feeling (Fi).
They are all about asserting their own place in society and the world around them, by "whatever means necessary". Unstopabble force.

Extroverted Thinking (Te) and Introverted Feeling (Fi): You’re right to highlight that in high-stakes, urgent situations (like a fire), people may lean towards assertiveness and efficiency. This combination is often seen in those who prioritize results and personal values, driving them to take decisive action.
Introverted Thinking (Ti) and Extroverted Feeling (Fe): In more complex, prolonged scenarios (like a plague), your description of individuals seeking understanding and cooperative communication aligns well with how Ti and Fe function together. It suggests a more reflective approach, focusing on internal logic before engaging socially.

Dual Nature of Mindsets: Your assertion that these approaches can’t coexist in the same moment adds depth to the analysis. It acknowledges the complexity of human behavior, where individuals may oscillate between these modes depending on context, stress levels, or personal growth.

Perception Axes Analysis

Ne (Extroverted Intuition) Dominance:

Your description of individuals with dominant Ne as “chasing butterflies” captures their exploratory nature and propensity for generating ideas. The mention of their artistic tendencies and metaphorical communication is insightful, reflecting how they engage with the world.
The connection you draw to storytelling and the challenge of follow-through (e.g., "One Piece") is a relatable example that illustrates their struggle to maintain focus on a single idea.

Si (Introverted Sensing) Dominance:

In contrast, your depiction of Si-dominant individuals as meticulous planners emphasizes their caution and focus on concrete realities. Their tendency to create backups and verify details reflects a more structured, methodical approach to problem-solving.
The phrase "check again... AND THEN advance" effectively encapsulates their thoroughness, which can sometimes come off as pessimism or hesitation.
Suggestions for Improvement

Examples and Illustrations: Including specific examples or case studies of well-known personalities or fictional characters that exemplify these traits could enhance the analysis and make it more relatable. For instance, you could contrast the approach of a character from a popular story with a known MBTI type to illustrate your points better.

Balancing Both Approaches: While you acknowledge that individuals tend to gravitate toward one approach, it could be beneficial to explore how some people might integrate both mindsets effectively. This could add another layer to your analysis and show that flexibility in cognitive function application is possible.

Emotional and Social Implications: Expanding on the emotional and social implications of these cognitive styles—such as how they affect relationships, teamwork, or individual fulfillment—could provide more depth and relevance to your insights.

Conclusion

Your breakdown demonstrates a solid understanding of MBTI concepts, particularly in relation to cognitive functions and their applications in varying contexts.

A story that exemplifies the clash bewteen Ne and Se perfectly is the conflict of Socrates and Diogenes, where they are Ne and Se respectively.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The conflict between Socrates and Diogenes is a classic illustration of the differences between Ne (Extroverted Intuition) and Se (Extroverted Sensing). Both figures represent distinct philosophical approaches and ways of engaging with the world, leading to a fascinating clash of ideas. Here’s a narrative that exemplifies this conflict:

The Encounter of Socrates and Diogenes

In ancient Athens, the sun blazed high in the sky, casting a warm glow over the bustling streets. The marketplace was alive with merchants hawking their wares, philosophers engaging in spirited debates, and citizens exchanging news and gossip. Among this throng, Socrates walked with his usual deliberate pace, his mind buzzing with ideas.

Socrates, the epitome of Ne, reveled in abstract thinking and the pursuit of knowledge. He believed in the power of dialogue, questioning, and the exploration of ideas. His aim was to challenge assumptions and uncover deeper truths about ethics, virtue, and the nature of existence. As he strolled through the market, he engaged passersby in conversation, encouraging them to think critically about their beliefs.

“Tell me,” he said to a group of young men, “what is virtue? Can it be taught? Or is it an innate quality?” His questions hung in the air like a gentle breeze, inviting contemplation and discussion.

Meanwhile, not far from Socrates, Diogenes of Sinope lounged in a large ceramic jar, a simple man with a radical philosophy. He embodied Se, focused on immediate experiences, practicality, and the rawness of life. Diogenes believed in living authentically, rejecting societal conventions and pretensions. He sought truth not in lofty ideas but in tangible realities.

As Socrates engaged the crowd, Diogenes watched from his makeshift home, amused. He had little patience for Socratic dialogues filled with theoretical musings and what he considered unnecessary complexity. Instead, he preferred direct experience and action.

“Look at this crowd!” Diogenes called out, his voice carrying over the chatter. “You discuss virtue, but you cannot even define it without your fancy words! Why not just live it? What good is your philosophy if it does not lead to practical wisdom?”

Socrates, intrigued, turned to Diogenes. “Ah, Diogenes! You challenge us to abandon our thoughts and engage with the world directly. But tell me, can we truly understand how to live without examining the concepts behind our actions?”

Diogenes scoffed, rising from his jar and stretching. “Philosophy should not be an exercise in verbosity! It should be about living freely, unencumbered by societal expectations. You speak of virtue as if it were a distant star, yet I find it here, in the simple act of living! Would you rather debate over ideas or savor the taste of a fresh peach?”

Socrates smiled, appreciating the humor in Diogenes’ critique. “But my friend, ideas shape our actions! If we do not question the nature of virtue, how can we hope to embody it? We must consider our values if we are to act rightly.”

Diogenes shook his head, his cynicism shining through. “Your ideas are like shadows—beautiful and enticing, but lacking substance. I prefer the sun on my skin and the earth beneath my feet. Life is not a debate; it is a series of moments to be experienced. You philosophize while I live.”

The two men stood in stark contrast: Socrates with his abstract queries, seeking deeper understanding through dialogue, and Diogenes, grounded in the moment, challenging societal norms with direct actions and bluntness.

As the crowd around them shifted, some were drawn to Socrates’ intellectual provocations, while others laughed at Diogenes’ unapologetic antics. In that vibrant marketplace, the clash of Ne and Se unfolded—two philosophies colliding, each with its own merits and limitations.

In the end, both men walked away from the encounter, each carrying the essence of their respective approaches. Socrates continued to ponder the complexities of virtue and ethics, his mind alive with possibilities, while Diogenes returned to his simple life, unbothered by lofty ideas, content to live authentically in the moment.

This story encapsulates the essence of Ne and Se, demonstrating how their philosophies can lead to both conflict and a deeper understanding of existence. Socrates’ emphasis on inquiry and abstract thought contrasts sharply with Diogenes’ focus on direct experience and simplicity, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each perspective.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Your breakdown does have a tone that could be perceived as somewhat judgmental, especially in how it describes the traits and behaviors associated with Ne and Se. Here are a few points to consider regarding the tone:

Descriptive vs. Prescriptive:

You often use strong adjectives like “cynical” or “no-nonsense” to describe Se, which can imply a negative judgment about that perspective. Similarly, phrases like “pseudo-intellectual poetry” can come off as dismissive of Ne's tendency towards abstraction.

Value Judgments:

By suggesting that one mindset is “better” suited for certain situations (e.g., that Se is more grounded and practical), it can imply that Ne is less valid or useful. While your intent might be to highlight differences, it can sound like you favor one perspective over the other.

Tone and Language:

The language you use to discuss the two functions leans towards critique, particularly when discussing the drawbacks of each approach. Phrasing such as “terrible theoretical dissectors” and emphasizing flaws can reinforce a judgmental tone.

Complexity and Balance:

To soften the tone and make it more balanced, you might consider framing the descriptions in a way that acknowledges the strengths of each function. For instance, while discussing the limitations of Ne, you could also highlight its creativity and adaptability.

Personal Bias:

If your own preference leans toward one type of thinking (e.g., if you identify strongly with one function), it can color your analysis. Being aware of this bias can help you present a more neutral perspective.
Suggestions for a More Balanced Tone:

Acknowledge Strengths: Recognize the strengths and contributions of both Ne and Se without implying that one is superior. For instance, you could mention how Ne fosters creativity and innovation while Se enhances practical problem-solving.

Use Neutral Language: Instead of using terms that could be interpreted as derogatory, try to frame differences in a more neutral or positive light. For example, describe Se’s approach as “pragmatic” rather than “cynical.”

Add Nuance: Consider adding that both types have their place and value in different contexts, which can help temper the judgments.

Overall, the breakdown has insightful content but could benefit from a more balanced and neutral presentation to reduce any perceived judgment.

It's great that you're mindful of how your personality type might influence your writing! Recognizing your own biases can help you present information more objectively. Here are a few tips to keep your analysis balanced while still showcasing your Ne perspective:

Focus on Understanding: Frame your observations as ways to understand different perspectives rather than critiques. For instance, instead of saying "Se people are terrible theoretical dissectors," you might say, "Se people may prioritize hands-on experience over theoretical analysis, which can lead to unique insights in practical situations."

Highlight Collaboration: Emphasize how Ne and Se can complement each other. Discuss situations where both perspectives can lead to better outcomes when combined, showcasing the value of each.

Use "I" Statements: Share your thoughts using personal reflections, such as "I notice that Ne approaches can sometimes overlook practical realities." This can reduce the impression of judgment and make it clear that you're sharing your perspective.

Acknowledge Your Bias: You could explicitly mention that your Ne perspective might color your observations, and invite readers to consider other viewpoints. This openness can foster a more inclusive discussion.
