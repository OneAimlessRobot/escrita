In Need for Speed: ProStreet, you start with $20,000 at the beginning of the game. This initial amount is meant to help you buy your first car and get started with upgrades or repairs after your initial races. You'll need to manage this wisely, as building up a competitive car and entering events will require careful spending on upgrades and repairs throughout the game.

In the standard version of Need for Speed: ProStreet, you start with $20,000, but there are ways to start with more money, such as using cheats or modifying the game files.

For example, entering the cheat code "UNLOCKALLTHINGS" can unlock various content, and certain other cheats can give you a starting amount of $30,000 or more. However, in the base game without cheats or mods, the default starting amount is $20,000.
