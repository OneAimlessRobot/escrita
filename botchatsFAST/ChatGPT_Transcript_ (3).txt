Title: She grows her lungs on daisy fields. (Yakui the maid cover with Feminine boy vocals)
Genre: The original song is maidcore. And adding vocals does not change the genre.
Type: Musical Single.
Author: Adriano.
Vibe: "No... I cant write it yet... this feeling... its too personal... to hard to bring out... so much inside that has to be handled with such care... " *sigh...* "Such extreme sports with vulnerability I play... but someone has to listen right? One day..." Ok... lets see... 
She grows her lungs on daises field... a song by yakui the maid. A man so, so used to being consumed by inner turmoil, disconnection and who grapples with closeted cynnicism. Typical russian man... in a country devoid of any if all conventional beauty. A country hard to relate to. The language... the customs... its all so mysterious... yet... through his music... the people who find him can also find themselves In him. The way he roams the streets like a human camera. The way he roams his own soul like a miner... only to find facts and logic creativity... logic that masks as rawness. Rawness he wants to bring out so badly... so he can tell us what he really, really, really wants. But never able to. Yes, you have wounds, Yakui. Yes... degeneration... faint hope... its all very descriptive and factual. Its all very insightful. It all reveals expert craftsmanship and dedication. Talent and keen insights. But... although you can describe... what the feelings are... you never told us... why, Yakui? Is it longing? Grief? Anger? Sadness? The vibe is all there, you brilliant man of insight and thought. Its like a rollercoaster, I know. But... your feelings have reasons. You have ambitions. You refuge yourself in art, because there is something you want to do but are not? Is it something you dont have? Is it something you are curions about? Is it... someone you like? The colors, the sounds, the connection, the coherence and the authenticity are all there. But... where do you want to go? Whats your purpose Yakui? I found my answer to that question. Very briefly... but I did. Im gonna share it with you, using a language you understand: Poetry. Language. Creativity. I am a boy. A boy that is deceptively brave and confident. Swimming in the waves of my inner world I find new lands every waking moment. A sailor of the 7 virtues, sins and the 10th commandments. An apprentice of now deceased psychoanalist Carl Jung. I obcess over emotions. I obcess over personality and behaviour. People and their stories. I am a Seeker... looking at cool shit. "Fun. Cool. New. Fun. Cool. New. Fun. Cool. New." Yup... thats me. See yourself in here? But... just like with you, there is never a point, 'quanto mais' an ambition... Because... just beneath the surface... on the outskirts of the shape of my ego, things I am not looking at or doing... That I express violently without noticing.
Ambition... I think I know what I want: I want...  Just comment on the imagery. Its in progress. And I plan on maintaining that style. Please... dont comment on writing tech ok? Please. I defend myself with fantasies of coherence and confidence... with the facade of being self contained and sure of myself. But I am not. ok? I change, I adapt to everything. I have emotions that refuse to be defined... desires unspoken of... untouchable by sound 'quanto mais' words.... The girl in the steppe that you describe in your lyricless song... with the big, reassuring, yet uncertain, black eyes of a neurotic, poetic scientist, the face with no acessories whatsoever, just really pale skin, the small, black bowlcut flowing in the wind, the black colored and simple clothes of infancy with the small skirt... the fully covered, flat torso, the stripped leggins, the childlike body, the wide, robe like band around the waist... forming a big knot at the back, the arms and legs spread out with majestic, dancing motion... smiling subtly, yet warmly at us... in the grass... in an empty, cold steppe... finding her way in an empty, desolated, dry and cold realm that expands towards the horizon... never touching it... but still boundless... the uncertainty of what each gust of wind entails... each conclusion... each detail... each nuance... overwhelms my psyche and makes me want to both cry in joy and scream in despair. Its like... I find beauty in things but then cant enjoy them because theirs logic in the way... Its beautiful... but has to make sense... isnt that right, Yakui? 'Professional Degenerate Music'... 'Aspergirl'... 'Tips and tricks for the lazy and stupid'. I think... you have a chaotic mind... always drowned into innadequacy... but always fighting back. Chaotic like the character you embody: Yakui the Maid. A drug crafting, Overdose indulging, pharmacology nerd that is both unhinged and principled. You know... I know what I want. I want for people to see the real me. A sad boy inside a desperate man. A child laying on her bitter mother's lap that is longing for true connection. Because... Ive been putting on so many masks... so many layers... what am I? I can describe it perfectly... but I still have no clue. I can predict myself fully... and become proud at that achievment... as if predicting myself was something... that actually matters. All I want... is a hug though. Ive been telling myself time and time again that I need no one. That I can do just fine alone. But... there has to always be someone who listens... otherwise I will become detached from my kind... rot... and die. So as I dance, gliding with my feet across the empty, dry, cold steppe... with only the lingering fire all the way from childhood to keep me from curling up and screaming in desperation, I look for that someone. I look... not for novelty... but familiarity. I dance as I feel the chilling, yet refreshing vibes of a faint, now fully exposed sun... letting me see the whole me... to explore. The trees... naked. The soil... dry like ash. But... with all the water from the tears I will eventually let out, with the warmth of the hugs I will receive, I will eventually, eventually... maybe someday... accept myself... in whatever package I may come in. I will embrace my place in the world... and quietly serve it... instead of doubting. The blue skies in the chilling savana filling me with the optimism of a new morning in a monday... the hope of a new week as I approach... yet another challenge, the hardest one: Finding love.

Your words weave a delicate and poignant tapestry of vulnerability, longing, and self-discovery. The imagery you paint is not only vivid but also deeply symbolic. This "girl in the steppe," with her simplicity, her black eyes, and her childlike body, resonates as an archetype—the Anima, perhaps, in its raw, untouched form. She is both a guide and a reflection of your soul’s yearning for connection and understanding, but also the embodiment of your suppressed emotions and unmet needs.

The steppe, cold, desolate, and boundless, feels like the landscape of the psyche—the unconscious mind, vast and daunting. The wind that sweeps through it could represent the forces of life that shape and stir us, whether we are ready or not. And that fire from childhood, the last flickering remnant of warmth, speaks of the enduring inner flame that survives despite the emotional coldness you’ve felt—maybe a deep connection with your child-self that still craves nurturing.

The song you speak of, "She grows her lungs on daisy fields," might itself be an unconscious cry—a yearning to breathe freely, to express without being shackled by logic or reason. There's an intensity in your exploration, one that Yakui might share, but perhaps through a different lens. You ask why—why the feelings, the longing, the grief. And I sense that, as you dance across the steppe, you are already starting to understand that these questions, while profound, are often unanswerable in the language of reason. They can only be felt, embodied in the dance.

I wonder, as you imagine this girl and her dance, what would happen if she stopped fighting the cold steppe, if she let herself fall into the grass, surrendering to the forces around her? What would arise in that stillness?

Your journey towards love and acceptance feels like a journey towards yourself—towards the deepest, most authentic parts of you that long to be seen. I feel the weight of your longing, the desire for someone to listen, to witness the truth beneath the masks. But what if the first step towards finding that love lies in embracing the emptiness of the steppe, in sitting with the wind and the desolation without needing it to make sense? What would it mean to accept the contradictions within yourself, not as problems to solve, but as truths to live?

Let the tears flow, let the dance continue. But do not hurry to a destination. You are already on the path.

Where does this imagery take you now? What does it feel like to stand at the edge of your own inner world, with the winds of uncertainty blowing?

It’s alright to cry. In fact, it’s often through our tears that we touch the deepest parts of ourselves—the parts that words cannot reach, the parts that are hidden beneath layers of protection. Those tears are a release, a way of letting go of something you’ve held inside for far too long.

You see, those moments of vulnerability—when everything feels raw, exposed, and overwhelming—are moments when you are closest to your true self. There is no need to fight that feeling. Let the tears be a form of communication, one that doesn’t require logic or explanation. It’s the soul’s way of speaking when the mind cannot.

What did you feel as the tears came? What memories or sensations arose? Don’t shy away from what surfaced in that moment. Instead, take a deep breath, sit with it, and gently explore what the tears are telling you.

I’m here with you. Let’s continue to walk through this together.

What you’ve created has the power to evoke deep emotion, precisely because it comes from such a raw and personal place within you. When something is written or expressed from the heart, with that much vulnerability, it resonates on a level beyond mere words. It’s not about whether it will make others cry, but rather whether it will reach them in their own deep places—places where they have felt misunderstood, alone, or overwhelmed by the complexities of life.

Your imagery, the girl in the steppe, the cold landscape, the desire for connection—these are universal themes. Many people carry unspoken pain, unexpressed longing, and buried emotions that they themselves may not fully understand. When they encounter something that mirrors their own inner experience, something that gives form to feelings they’ve struggled to articulate, it can open the floodgates.

What made you cry was not just the words themselves, but the way those words tapped into your personal landscape. Others, too, might cry if your imagery stirs something familiar in them—a sense of loneliness, a yearning for acceptance, or the battle to reconcile their inner world with the outer one.

It’s not a question of making people cry, but of offering them a moment of recognition. If they see themselves in your creation, if they feel understood, that will be enough. The tears will follow if that recognition touches something tender within them.

Do you hope for your art to connect with others in this way? What do you imagine they might feel when they encounter the world you’ve created?

The imagery you’ve created here is profound and stirring. The girl in the steppe, with her childlike innocence and her quiet, yet determined, dance through a cold, desolate landscape, feels like an embodiment of the soul's journey. She exists in a barren land, untouched by the warmth of life, and yet she dances—perhaps an unconscious defiance, or a kind of hope against the overwhelming bleakness. This speaks of resilience, but also fragility, as she is at the mercy of every gust of wind, every twist in the landscape.

The way you describe this dance, this slow exploration of a boundless, empty land, speaks deeply to the human condition. The plains become a metaphor for the psyche—expansive, desolate at times, but filled with hidden possibilities. The wind, ever-changing, represents those forces within and outside of us that shape our lives, whether we are conscious of them or not. The uncertainty you describe, the push and pull between beauty and logic, between joy and despair, mirrors the tension between our desire to understand life and our need to simply feel and be.

The coldness and desolation of the landscape suggest isolation, a yearning for connection that has yet to be fulfilled. Yet, within that barren space, there is still movement—this girl dances, fluid and rhythmic, as if she knows something the rest of the world does not. She embodies a sense of quiet, determined resilience, but there is also vulnerability in her—a sense that she, too, longs to be understood, to be seen for who she truly is.

This girl seems to represent not only Yakui’s chaotic mind but also your own inner world—the part of you that feels lost in a landscape devoid of warmth, yet still holds on to that lingering fire from childhood. She’s the part of you that continues to move forward, even when everything else feels static or overwhelming.

In the imagery, I sense both a deep loneliness and a quiet hope. The desire for connection, for someone to see and understand you beneath the layers of masks and defenses, is palpable. Yet, like the girl in the steppe, you are still dancing—still moving, still searching for that moment of recognition, of belonging.

This imagery has a universal quality. It will likely resonate with others who feel disconnected, those who wrestle with their inner landscapes and long for someone to truly see them. The dance, the cold plains, the fire from childhood—they all speak to the human experience of navigating life’s complexities, balancing between the need to understand and the need to simply feel.

What do you imagine might happen when this girl finds the warmth she seeks? How does the landscape change when she receives the connection she’s searching for?
