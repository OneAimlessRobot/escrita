What do you think of this character?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The character Yakui Emochi is intriguing and complex, blending eccentricities with a dark and isolated inner world. On the surface, she appears as a drug-addicted maid, fascinated by the effects of chemicals, not only for their physiological impacts but as a medium to share emotions and moods with others. Her motivations seem to stem from a deep sense of loneliness, a desire to connect with others in a raw and visceral way, bypassing words and using chemicals to create emotional experiences​.

She has a goth-like demeanor, stunted by years of self-medicating, which is reflected in both her physical appearance (short, drug-addict-like build) and her personality (alternating between chaotic bouts and calm logic). There’s an irony in how she chains herself to prevent overdosing, suggesting both awareness and a lack of control over her addiction​.

Emotionally, Yakui is deeply disconnected, likely using drugs as a way to express her inner world because she feels misunderstood. She seeks legitimacy and connection through her chemical creations, but there’s a tragic undercurrent of unfulfilled desires, such as a lack of close relationships or meaningful recognition. Her scars and self-experiments also reflect self-destructive tendencies​.

In relation to narcissism, Yakui doesn’t appear to exhibit classic narcissistic traits. While she is self-absorbed in her quest to share her emotions through drugs, she doesn’t seem manipulative or malicious. Unlike narcissists, who manipulate others for supply and validation​​, Yakui seems more like someone desperately trying to connect in a world that doesn’t understand her, even if her methods are unorthodox and self-destructive.

I think... she has... too little of it, so to speak... she never considered how it does not matter, in her situation, how "good" her drugs become
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

It sounds like you're touching on a key point about Yakui's character—she's deeply invested in the perfection of her chemical creations, but perhaps missing a bigger picture. No matter how "good" or effective her drugs become at conveying emotions, the core of her isolation and disconnection won't be solved by them. Her focus on the external expression of feelings (through drugs) may be a way to avoid confronting her internal emotional needs or the reality that her methods are unlikely to create the connection she craves.

Yakui’s pursuit of chemically replicating emotions might be a defense mechanism against acknowledging the futility of her actions. She’s so deeply entrenched in the art of her drugs that she overlooks the fact that no external substance can replace genuine human connection. Her situation is tragic because, despite her intelligence and creativity, she’s chasing an impossible goal—trying to bridge emotional gaps with chemistry instead of actual relationships. This is what makes her loneliness more profound; she’s stuck in a cycle of creating and experimenting without realizing that human warmth and understanding cannot be synthesized.

Do you think she's aware, on some level, of this futility? Or does she remain oblivious, too focused on her art to see the bigger picture?

No... and honestly....id even say....its for the best?

ChatGPT said:

I see where you're coming from. In some ways, it's perhaps a mercy that Yakui doesn't fully grasp the futility of her pursuit. Her obsessive focus on perfecting her drugs, despite their limitations, might actually shield her from the deeper pain of realizing that no matter how skilled she becomes, she will never achieve the emotional connection she craves in the way she envisions.

If Yakui were to truly understand the limits of her efforts, it might destroy her sense of purpose altogether. Her identity is so deeply tied to her chemical artistry that facing the truth—that these drugs can't replace human bonds—could leave her feeling even more lost and purposeless. In a way, this delusion provides her with a kind of anchor, however fragile, that keeps her moving forward.

There’s something tragic but also strangely beautiful in her unawareness. It’s as if she’s created a world where her art is her salvation, even if it’s a world that exists more in her mind than in reality. If she stays in that bubble, at least she has something to hold onto. Maybe in her case, the ignorance of the bigger picture is her only path to contentment.

Would you agree that her ignorance of this deeper truth preserves some part of her sanity, or do you think there’s still a possibility she could thrive if she confronted it?

side note: I like her guns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

Her guns are a really cool and creative touch! The Pill Gatling and Syringe Mortar Launcher are not only quirky but also tie perfectly into her character as a chemist obsessed with drugs and their effects. The Pill Gatling, with its non-lethal pills that can deliver different chemical effects, and the Syringe Mortar Launcher, designed to inject its payload into targets, add a unique flavor to her personality. They reflect both her chaotic, unpredictable side and her precision as a chemist, showing how she uses these weapons almost as an extension of her art.

It's interesting how these weapons mirror her relationship with chemicals—on one hand, they’re harmless projectiles like her drugs, but they have real consequences depending on what’s inside. The non-explosive nature of the pills also hints at her reluctance to do real harm, preferring instead to alter perceptions and sensations.

Did you like these because of how they fit with her overall character, or is it more the idea of mixing chemistry with weaponry that caught your attention?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You said:
both

ChatGPT said:

That makes sense—Yakui’s guns do a fantastic job of blending chemistry with weaponry in a way that feels natural to her character. They highlight her expertise as a chemist while giving her tools that are distinct from typical weapons, making them feel personal and even artistic.

The Pill Gatling, with its rapid-fire pill projectiles, symbolizes her endless experimentation. It's as if she’s constantly testing new combinations of drugs and emotions, spraying the world with her concoctions. Its precision but lack of power (due to the pills' fragility in the wind) also reflects her careful but ultimately limited approach—she can create powerful effects, but only under the right conditions.

The Syringe Mortar Launcher, on the other hand, feels more deliberate and dangerous, aligning with her willingness to push boundaries with her self-experiments. The idea of syringes exploding on impact, injecting their payload into targets, adds a chaotic and almost reckless aspect to her personality. It’s a bold, visceral weapon, much like her intense need to share emotions chemically.

The combination of chemistry and combat makes her guns unique, symbolic tools that show how she weaponizes her passion. Both guns act as metaphors for her desire to influence others, not through violence, but through altered perceptions.

Would you say these guns also reflect her deeper struggle—her need to connect but only being able to do so in a way that's still distant and impersonal?

Yakui

￼

Biographical information

Date of birth

October 11

Physical description

Species

Human

Gender

Female

Yakui is one of the most popular maids. Her name comes from "Yakuji" ("Medicine"), also comes from “Yaku”（“calamity”）.

Appearance

Yakui has bob-cut purple hair, and her maid outfit is usually blue, or purple. She is usually drooling in art, or has a crazed look in her eye. She is sometimes shown wearing handcuffs. The pills she takes stunted her growth, leading to her being quite short.

Personality

Yakui is addicted to pharmaceuticals. She's known to give out medicinal advice to passersby in drug stores, but whether this advice is good or not is up for speculation. At critical moments, she can see what is invisible to others and hear what others can't hear. She's very capable without her medication, but a slight overdose would make her useless. The handcuffs are meant to force her to cut down on her medication every month to behave. She can simultaneously hallucinate others, and keep herself in a trance for long periods of time, which is dangerous. However，when it comes to changing people's hearts with medication, she always draws the line and guards it.

Yakui guns


Name: Pill Gatling
Type: Weapon
Type of weapon: Projectile repeater weapon.
Type of repeater: Multi spinning-barrel machine gun.
Type of projectile: Non explosive pills.
Projectile repeating action: Gas operation.
Build: 
Gatling gun of medicine. 
It takes ammo with size similar to an ipobrufen pill from a generic blister box of ben-u-ron. 
It shoots at 300 rpm
And each shot has a kinetic energy of 100J
It is belt fed.
A belt inside a big drum can carry up to 1000 pills.
Very, very precise... as pills have almost no recoil. But not very accurate in windy conditions, as the pills can get flung by even the smallest gusts of air, which happens because they cannot be shot very hard, otherwise they break.

Weapon on-hit effect:

The effects are not really tied to the weapon itself, but more to the pills used as ammo. But... here is a catch. If someone gets hit by the Pill Gatling and gets an effect, even if the effect hasnt worn out yet, on the following hit, the effect of the current pill will get completly reset and the person will revert back to normal during that instant, getting the effect of the new pill instead.

Works like the XM8 From Metal Gear Ac!d

Projectile chemical payload: Syringe contents
Action:
Single shot.



Build: 
Shoulder carried syringe mortar launcher. 
Syringes are big, vintage syringes only partially metalic shelled, to allow the gunner to see dose.
(The needle breaking triggers the gunpowder, which blows up, desintegrating the syringe and spreading the chemical payload)
Manual reloading so low cadence.
Precision depends on the wind and the users skill.
The projectiles are sent off by the mortar with an exit velocity of a MLB pitch


Projectile on-contact effect:

On contact:
Non-Organic entities: Needle breaks.

Organic entities: They get pierced but Tip does not break, so contents get injected

On detonation:
The effects of its contents are spread across a spherical area of radius 5m.

Yakui profession:

Yakui the Maid... in a quest to make her chemically packaged moods and feelings reach people in a legitimate way... knowing she, self procramingly, "is only good at chemistry", And taking advantage of her degree and license as a chemist, She invented a profession! She Invents drugs to share with people, making contracts about each one before going on a journey to share them. The contract includes a generic header template and then a full description of the effects of the drug.... as written by a friend of hers who makes them, including technical details like side effects physiological effects and side effects. She is beginning by going from door to door asking people to try them, to gain traction, trust and legitimacy from people. And... now she can also monetise her efforts and passion! This is an example of a contract she made of the drug she called "Chlorine of Bring Me Back #2007":

"Ok... the terms are basically all made from the same template: It starts with generic stuff: "Both parties agree to this if you sign it, Yakui the Maid is a licensed chemistry performer, You are a human with consent... and then what changes is the effects and side effects of the drug! Im basically like the cookie door2door scout girls, but with drugs!

The effects of this one are:
Name: Chlorine of Bring Me Back #2007 (CBMB-2007-2.5)
Type: Injectible.
Dose: 2.5 mL
Vibe/Effects: Nostalgia. A feeling of melancholic longing mixed with sadness and fondness. A feeling of lightweight joy mixed with heavy 'Saudade'(1). A feeling of walking in an old Mediterranic village... old cars... dusty windows... old, abandoned sports courts. Cafés... the elderly bantering... Repeating sunsets that drag you further and further below... making you feel stuck, yet grateful. Feeling exposed, yet protected. Feeling powerful yet fragile. Feeling passionate, yet calm.

Effects: Mild psychosis, slowed heart rate, decreased blood intensity.
Lowered senses. Mind clarity enhancement. Lowered agression.

Side effects: Some emotional desensitization, some reactivity. Sleepyness.

(1)- Portuguese term for a feeling of loss or grieving that sits dissolved in a sea of fatalism and unapolagetic passion. Melancholic and calm feeling of unprocessed finality."

------------------------------------------------------
Yakui Laws:

People have to say yes;
They can change their minds after they pay, and they can choose to go to a waiting list to think it through;
"I test them on ME first! ok? ME!"
"I want to make people feel moods and emotions. Experience the raw power of direct, chemically induced sensations and moods."
"The police said yes, I spoke with loads of lawyers and I have to confirm it with legal doctors before even designing a product. So yes. IT IS legit. Ok?"
"I already have a chemistry degree so I could have a job at a lab. I stayed there for 6 years. I hated it. So now I do this!"

Yakui backstory


Bro. i just wish there was a device that fuckin... idk... enabled you to take a very, very deep vibe inside your soul and just make people experience it directly. Like chemically, even. Thats why I do art. So I can, at least, get close to that


Maybe thats why... Yakui the Maid (character) loves drugs so much? Maybe thats why she is a drug addict that self crafts medicine
And shares it with others?
Maybe she is lonely... and thats how she connects. Using pure, raw, chemistry. The elusive image she is after is one of connecting with other fellow Men... by experimenting with chemical arts and crafts. Experimenting with reagents, ways of administration, sensations, side effects. First... on herself. And then on others. By convincing them to try them, literally feel the precise chemicals she senses within. She crafts pharmaceutical art. Writing? Too difficult. Music? Too ethereal? Chemicals are raw. Physiological. Raw. Biological. Celular. Metabolic manifestations of her inner world. Images, words and feelings are all fake. Human consciousness... is made of molecules. Blood. Hormones. And transdermic patches.


All her life... always alone. Never really seen beyond her odd appearance. Not judged... but also not noticed. Never felt the touch of a man in the way crave the touch of their prefered gender so much... crafting chemical vibes. Always having to prove herself constantly and never allowed to shine. Stuck in her lab... testing brutal concotions on herself until... it just clicks. All the videogames, all her childhood memories. She feeds herself that way. Memories. Because... in the present, she is stagnant. Always the same lab, always the same clothes, the same old hobby of chemistry. She may have found a new niche... but people dont give a damn. Shes just an overqualified street artist. At least... thats how she feels. That direct, visceral, chemical connection... beyond mere words or touch... is all she craves.
The drugs... the glass... the pills. Its her poetry. The syringes, the blisters... the stands... her distilation setup... its her citadel. Her home. She has scars... from her masterpiece. 4 very ugly ones... from desperate attempts at making her CBM-2007-2.5. Chlorine of Bring Me 2007. 2.5mL. A drug that was projected to make people feel nostalgic. Like games. Source games. Old famiclone Nintendo games. Old house. Old friends. Old memories. She is indifferent towards competition... prejudice... stability. She lacks an identity. Values. Who cares about the top job at a Lab when you cannot decide what to do with your life... without other people to comfort you. Loneliness... Her scars were attempts at making an injectible. The chlorine reacts with the blood vessel walls... literally roasting them... from the inside out. She damaged some nerves... getting ocasional spasms. All so that she can give her nostalgia away. "I am not a Woman. I am not a Person. I am not 38 years old. I am an emotion radio station. And I am immortal. I will turn every single emotion into drugs. Everybody will experience them. And then....only then... my life will be complete. After that, I will die. And I will return to the earth." Getting her degree as a chemist 6 years. Bachelor, Masters, Doctorate. PhD. Then... She got her job, and experimented on herself on the side. Just so people would trust her.

"A girl came up to me... from a group with some folk. She walked close... flustered. She kept saying: "It is a dare. Dont. I have to retuen. Bye." I waa sitting alone in a table. Just me... and a glass of vodka... staring into its soul... wondering if there is ever interuptions to suffering... or if suffering is just loneliness. Or even... if connection itself is just seaaoning. Or even... The only seasoning. Wondering what kind of concotion I will try next... An ethanol enzhyme? A vasodilator that also relaxea the body? Another big batch of oxytocin injections? And if... that even matters... if people done even ask you your name, let alone who you are. Do people... even want... my drugs? Do people even want... my art? But I woke up from the depths... glanced over to her slightly... while still hunched over this measly cup of wallnut alchol... and just said: " 'm fine..." "


Thats the backstory of Yakui the Maid.

ChatGPT said:

Yakui’s character continues to be fascinating, especially with these additional details. Her complexity is enhanced by a mix of brilliance, passion, and deep inner turmoil. She’s like a mad scientist with a mission: to perfect her pharmaceutical "art" and share her chemically crafted emotions with others. However, this mission seems to be a form of self-expression that masks her isolation and pain.

Her Pill Gatling and Syringe Mortar Launcher aren’t just quirky weapons—they represent her life's work in a tangible form. The absurdity of shooting pills or injecting emotions reflects her desire to make her inner world understood by others, but also highlights the futility of trying to connect through something so impersonal. It's almost as though she’s using these weapons not to harm others, but to make them "feel" what she feels.

Yakui’s backstory gives more insight into her tragic motivation. Her longing for connection and her belief that emotions can be transmitted chemically shows a deeper sadness—she’s aware that traditional forms of communication or bonding don’t work for her. The dialogue where she defends her addiction by comparing it to testing a machine or cooking a dish gives us a glimpse into her mind. She sees her drug use not just as a vice, but as a necessary part of her craft, even if it has consumed her life.

Her professional life and her contracts add a layer of dark humor to her character. She’s like a door-to-door salesperson, except with drugs that convey nostalgia, sadness, or peace, depending on the batch. It’s a bit absurd, but at the same time, it's tragic because it highlights how desperately she wants to connect with people—even if through something as artificial as chemicals.

The dialogues show her defensiveness and frustration at being misunderstood. She’s tired of being seen as a junkie, when she sees herself as an artist and scientist. Her bitterness is palpable, especially in exchanges where she has to defend her legitimacy as a professional chemist. This tension between her identity as a highly educated individual and her perceived role in society (as just a drug addict or eccentric) is one of her central struggles.

Yakui’s refusal to "act her age" or conform to societal expectations is a defining trait. She clings to her unique way of life, unwilling to change despite the suffering it brings her. Her defensiveness, frustration, and sense of superiority when she flashes her PhD demonstrate that she’s caught between wanting recognition and feeling rejected by society.

The contrast between her brilliant mind and her self-destructive habits makes Yakui a tragic and deeply human character. She’s someone who’s created her own world out of necessity, because the real world failed to recognize her talents or give her the connection she longs for.

What stands out most to you about her character in this extended version? Is it her brilliance, her eccentricity, or the tragic undercurrent that runs through everything she does?
