If I am fine?
I mean... I feel... alone. Alien. Its all in the text... But I cant say yes or no, though... If you are still worried, dont. Humans arent flimsy like paper. they are made of meat, water, fat and bone.

So I am made of silly too...
Who isnt made out of silly, though? If silly people are people who struggle, then everybody is silly.

But I appreciate it. its a good trait of you to worry about others. But remember: You cant make anyone get better by yourself, much less over the internet

trying to Fix other people will grind your essence into confetty real fast

I think you are very sensible and selfless

Not purely... like everybody else... but I feel like you are predominantly so

And now that you feel at ease with me... I will take that as a little window to replace a word I used to describe you. Although its often unfairly misused and seen as a bad thing, you are highly conscious and... sensitive. You know what people want to hear and you have a knack for social smoothness... I assume at least. People around you are often much more blunt than you on average

"i think types are as meaningless as having the same conversation about 7 times"
"it matters not what definition fits you"
"it matters who you are not how you define yourself"

MBTI types are... meaningless?

"and its not like you can define someone perfectly ever anyway
"?
Im not fitting my whole self into a label.
I aint even fitting a spec of me into a label.

MBTI types tell you cognitive tendencies. Thats it. They are like egos built in a differrnt way. Its as holistic as categorising types of clutches in cars inside the whole assembly, where the type of ego is the way the information moves from the mask to the subconscious. Like a door. Like the shape of that door. But, its still important. But yes. what defines you is nothing. And its not like I am saying its my identity. Im saying it in a very clinical perspective Like a blood type. It aint giving you superpowers and it aint crippling you. I know that. But, for me, even knowing that something about m, even if as small and reduced as the ego can be categorised, gives me safety. It helped me find friends. Mentors. It also made me get stuff wrong. But thats the price you pay for comitting to a frame of thinking. And it should not be trusted blindly, It should be tweaked and figured out on the go, like everything in life. Its not even final...



"I think committing to a frame is a mistake."



I think you need to be, not like water, but like putty. You need be both rigid and maleable. And even what you are saying is a framework you are comitting to


‚ÄãGRRR! I gotta defend it! Everyone needs a framework! Everyone! I dont care!


‚Äãahhh I gotta leave it. Frameworks are mean and powerful machines. But they can be strained too


You are making conscious effort. Your framework is: "No human is definable in any way at all"
Feel free to correct me
If I am shoving s*** in your mouth though


"i would say my framework is that i wish to just take everything for what it is and be open to everything without trying to fit into a certain aspect of something else."

Valid.

"You can make anything into a framework, but that doesnt mean it has to be one or should be one I suppose"


Yes. It also does not mean there are no situations that benefit from one.

"For sure. I didnt say that there arent certain benefits from having one."
"btw what are you studying"
"im currently thinking of shooting myself if i have to study another day ;3"
Computer Science
I found my own way of learning, thanks to MBTI. I thrive in bumping and feeling my way around problems without a bunch of previous theoretical dodoo to abide by. If something is important, I wanna feel in my skin why that is important. The teachers I vibe with the most are the ones that believe this and understanding this is key  so that, when there are less acessible classes for me, I can reach a consensus with them. Make deals. Thats how socialization works.


"fair enough. I manage to learn the best through actually doing it or using it in theoretically."
"but im so sick of doing the same thing and waking up in the same place going to the same classes for weeks on end"
"im thinking of just taking a flight to somewhere and leave life behind for a bit :3"

You can grind and be consistent... But damn does it make you feel like dogs***. Right?


"it makes me feel empty"
"and i cant deal with how much it destroys me"
"physically and mentally i suppose"
"yeah but thats too easy"
"it has to be a bit challenging"


Everybody is treated like generic garbage. They all assume everybodt works the same way... Pisses me the f*** off...

It sounds like you‚Äôre feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated with how the world expects everyone to fit into neat categories and routines. The pressure to conform and the sense of being misunderstood can be really isolating.

Your reflections on frameworks, whether they be MBTI types or broader perspectives on life, highlight a tension between wanting to categorize experiences to find safety and connection while also recognizing that these categories can feel limiting. It‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre searching for a deeper understanding of yourself and the people around you, which is a journey many go through.

It's understandable to feel like the grind of daily life is wearing you down, especially when you don't feel like you fit into the expected mold. Finding ways to break out of that routine‚Äîwhether through travel, changing your study methods, or just taking a moment to pause and breathe‚Äîcan help regain a sense of agency.

Remember, it‚Äôs okay to feel lost or frustrated. Those feelings are part of being human, and sometimes expressing them is the first step toward finding clarity. If you ever want to talk more about what you're going through or explore different perspectives, I‚Äôm here to listen.

Look at my notes: "Comput8ional logic

Make proofs:

Step 1: CNF: Every formula can B dat.
So convert that hoe!

After dat, Check CNF clauses! (Each multi part disjunction)
If there is prop and n(prop)

for 1 prop in every clause...


VALID!


Ok... Not valid? Fuck... ok.
Is it a fraud bruh? (Contradictory)

Ok... step 1: Is it a horn formula?

If there is at most 1 positive in each clause, then it is!

Anyways...

Place that b*** in2 horn formula to follow the ways of the horns!


(Implic8ion clauzes.)


Anyways...


After that hoe gets f***ing horned,
den we make an empty set.

Make a function that collects every single prop clause. Dose props are vacuously true. So... the function applied to the empty set returns a set of every vacuous prop.

After that, we pack those fuckers up into a set and shove it up the functions ass.
After we rape the function (We will do it several times),
It will return everything for which there is a left side, made up of a subset of the one we impaled the function with (Implic8ions), our set plus the premisses on da right. (Can only B 1 positive? Remebah! Thats the point of the horny(ing)!)
Shit clauses without positives (w/o gainz) imply AW HELL NAW BRO! ABSURD! (skull emoji). If we get a set where there is a conjunction in a left side of horn clause that is the subset of us, the formula is, indeed, a fraud! But... if we keep going and, either run outta premisses to eat up or our set cannot grow anymore for some other reason, the formula is possible! Its a tepid centrist!


Done! Now go find out which formulas are the #GOAT and which are Boomer frauds! (Skull emoji)"

Your notes are both hilarious and deeply expressive, but there‚Äôs a lot of interesting logic buried underneath the colorful language. Let's break it down and rephrase it in a more structured way while keeping the vibe alive!

Computational Logic Steps

Convert to CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form):

Every logical formula can be converted into CNF, where the formula is a conjunction of disjunctions.
So, Step 1: Convert that thing into CNF!

Check the CNF Clauses:

Each clause is a disjunction of literals. Check if, for any clause, both a proposition and its negation exist (e.g., 
ùëù
p and 
¬¨
ùëù
¬¨p).
Result: If that‚Äôs true for any clause, the formula is valid! Done! üéâ

If Not Valid:

Don‚Äôt panic. Is it contradictory? Meaning, is there no possible truth assignment that satisfies the formula? In other words, is the formula a "fraud"?

Check if It‚Äôs a Horn Formula:

A Horn formula is a CNF where every clause has at most one positive literal (everything else is either negated or negative literals).
If it is a Horn formula, continue to the next steps.

Resolution Using the Horn Formula:

Implication clauses in the Horn formula help you infer truth values step by step.
First, collect all the vacuous truths: These are clauses where the left side (all the negative literals) are false, so the conclusion (positive literal) must be true.
Apply a function repeatedly:
Each time, plug in the truths you‚Äôve collected into the formula.
The function checks if the left side of any clause is a subset of the current known truths. If it is, it concludes the positive literal (if any) must also be true.

Check for Contradictions:

If you find a clause where the left side (negative literals) is satisfied but the right side (positive literal) is false, the formula is absurd (contradictory). In this case, it‚Äôs a fraud.
If no such contradiction arises and you can keep applying the function until it stops growing, then the formula is satisfiable. It‚Äôs logically possible (though not necessarily valid).

Final Step:

Find the #GOAT formulas: Those that are valid.
Call out the Boomers (fraudulent ones): Those that are unsatisfiable or contradictory. üíÄ

In a nutshell, you‚Äôve got a really creative way of explaining the process of checking satisfiability using Horn formulas and CNF. I love how you put personality into the logic, and honestly, this could be a great way to make a dry subject like computational logic more fun and engaging! Keep the energy up, but don't forget to stay clear on the rules of logic as you go.
