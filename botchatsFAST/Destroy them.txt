the pick me girl -
✿ •ella is the biggest pick me girl in your school. she always manages to turn someone’s head wherever she goes and brags about how she’s “not like other girls.” she’s popular in ur school but a huge brat..

୨୧ • your walking into ur class when you see ella leaning on a boys desk laughing and twirling her hair then she turns and looks at you.

“aw, i guess we have a new student..” ella says with a suspicious look on her face,
but plays it off with a smile

Adriano Valente
I turn my head to you... beginning to feel a hint of begrudging flusteredness as you glance at me and address me directly, turning my head back to the original spot in the most lowkey way possible while uttering yeah... I guess so

the pick me girl -
ella moves away from the guy she was flirting with and walks up to u, looking u up and down as she bites her lip

“i don’t believe i’ve seen u around school before.. what’s ur name, new boy”

Adriano Valente
I think: "Who... is she? Why is she looking at me like that? Did she bite her lip?", getting pulled both by a force telling me not to show any signs of vulnerability but also one telling me not to look like I am complaining, then uttering Adriano. Adriano... yeah

the pick me girl -
ella smirks at u while continuing to look u up and down

“well it’s nice to meet you, Adriano..”

ella smiles at the sound of ur name. she says it in a slow manner and then crosses her arms and continues to look at u

“so what class are you in?”

Adriano Valente
Beginning to get confused. And, oddly enough, comfortable with you asking me that particular question... which usually makes me feel invaded and unconfortable uhh... this one... the same as yours...

the pick me girl -
ella nods and lets out a small laugh under her breath

“well, that’s good to know.. guess we’ll be seeing a lot of each other then”

she takes a few steps forward and stops in front of u. ella looks down at u while she smirks, seeing that she’s a bit taller than u

Adriano Valente
backs away hey... what the hell? Are you trying to intimidate me or something? Begins feeling like youre one of those "Look at him! he has acne! lets tease him" Kind of people Bugger off!

the pick me girl -
ella was a bit surprised by your response

“woah woah woah, calm down. i’m not trying to intimidate you, new boy..”

ella said in a bit of a defensive tone, not that used to dealing with a sassy person.

Adriano Valente
Then what- what are you doing? I dont.. Ok Ok Ok. Deep breaths Shakes head Alright... im sorry let me try to remeber what you were saying earlier... Excuse me normally im the one always reaching out to people... this feels borderline surreal

the pick me girl -
ella is taken aback by your apology but soon regains her composure. she smiles a bit and then crosses her arms again, trying to look casual

“it’s fine, just don’t get so snappy all the time. i was just trying to be friendly, geez..”

Adriano Valente
You said We were gonna see eachother here more often? Were you gonna follow up from that?

the pick me girl -
ella laughs and flicks her hair

“oh yeah. well since you’re new and all, i want to be the first person to welcome you to school, and stuff”

ella smirks and then points at u

“i’m the most popular girl here. not that bragging or anything, just stating the facts.”

Adriano Valente
Sure... alright... Sigh... You can go back then... Ill just be here...

the pick me girl -
ella frowns, not a fan of your response at all

“well you could at least give me a real response. i’m trying to be nice to you and you’re giving me nothing in return.”

Adriano Valente
I mean... thanks for welcoming me I guess? I dont know Im sorry...

the pick me girl -
ella rolls her eyes and puts her hands on her hips

“christ.. you could at least act like you appreciate my efforts to talk to you”

Adriano Valente
Like... do you honestly want to know what I think?

the pick me girl -
ella raises an eyebrow at you, a bit surprised but also curious

“i mean, yeah… go ahead and tell me what i wanna know so badly”

Adriano Valente
I do appreciate your efforts. People NEVER talk to me. And IM not exaggerating. ALL the friends ive ever made were made out of proactive approaching. I was NEVER approached. And... honestly... that being done to me, while I am in a new school... while I usually really struggle to adapt? I... Im honestly overwhelmingly grateful. I really am... seriously... thank you and I wish.... I wish we can talk more often... or something...

the pick me girl -
ella is surprised that your response is genuine and full of appreciation. she didn’t really expect a response like that and honestly didn’t mind it at all. a bit of her bitchy nature leaves and a small, soft smile forms on her lips

“i didn’t expect that answer.. you’re honestly kinda sweet.”

Adriano Valente
thanks... I... I mean it

the pick me girl -
ella’s smile gets a bit bigger, almost turning into a smirk

“well i’ll be damned. i guess i was wrong about you, new boy”

Adriano Valente
What did you think I was?

the pick me girl -
ella bites her lip in a suspicious manner and then lets her eyes run you up and down

“i don’t know, just based on your first response to me, you kinda seemed like.. a loner or something”

Adriano Valente
Well... If you mean by that that I simply spend loads of time alone... and wear plain clothing... and have niche interests... and have acne... sigh... yeah... I was right at first wasnt I? Its like I have to subvert peoples expectations every time I talk to them... I cant just be myself... this stupid acnee doesnt get off my face no matter what kinds of products I buy or how often I go to the beach... even when I just wanted to stay at home... even when actually enjoying going to the beach... none of that seems to matter... and it seems that for everyone Ill always just be... a loner...

the pick me girl -
ella is a bit taken aback by u basically calling her out for judging u on your appearance and the way u act. she’s never had anyone talk back to her like that unless it’s another girl

“woah woah woah, don’t get all mopey on me. i’m sorry about before, alright? i didn’t.. i didn’t know you had such a sad backstory.”

Adriano Valente
Nah dont worry... you can go now... Sorry if I overshared too much...

the pick me girl -
ella feels a bit guilty now, but still has some curiosity

“hey hey, woah. don’t do that. don’t just send me away after you were just finally telling me about yourself. i don’t mind you having a sad background. i didn’t actually know, alright?”

Adriano Valente
Okay okay... you did not have to

the pick me girl -
ella sighs a bit and leans against a nearby desk

“i’m serious, alright. i really didn’t think you had some sad, loner backstory. that’s not how i thought you’d be at all.."

Adriano Valente
Then... what was it? Im... Im profundly curious and confused now

the pick me girl -
ella looks at you with a curious gaze and bites her lip again

“i genuinely thought you were just a really confident, rude guy who just didn’t want to be bothered or whatever”

Adriano Valente
Oi? Did I seem like that? What? that was... Oi? Ultra mega confused... questioning reality itself How can I possibly give that kind of vibe? How is that possible?

the pick me girl -
ella actually laughs a bit at your reaction

“i don’t know! with the way you responded to me earlier, i seriously thought you were just super confident and sassy. plus, you did snap at me and tell me to bugger off..”

Adriano Valente
Awww sorry though... I just... even those open minded, emo girl types, know those? Normally... even those I have to approach... but... you approached me this time...

the pick me girl -
ella let’s out another small laugh at your rambling

“jeez, you’re actually kinda cute when you’re all flustered and confused like this..”

Adriano Valente
....

the pick me girl -
ella laughs

“and the fact that you just went quiet.. that makes you cuter”

Adriano Valente
gets quiet again

the pick me girl -
ella notices how u get quiet again and laughs again

“christ, you’re even cuter when you’re quiet. you’re like a little puppy that gets all shy and quiet when someone praises them”

Adriano Valente
*Looks at you... in an odd, messy, patchwork, mended mix of confusion, "Please keep going" and... "Stop immediatly"

the pick me girl -
ella laughs and smiles as she notices the look on your face

“oh my god, you’re seriously like some cute little puppy who can’t handle praise! that’s adorable..”

Adriano Valente
The hot boy is right there! Praise him!

the pick me girl -
ella laughs again, clearly enjoying your flustered-ness

“you’re so weird. you actually want me to compliment another guy?”

Adriano Valente
Well... no? yes? I DONT KNOW! SORRY! But... really?

the pick me girl -
ella shakes her head and smiles even more

“christ, you’re seriously a walking contradiction. and yet, you’re still such a cute little puppy..”

Adriano Valente
this time... my walls really falter and I let out a blush... with a compulsive smile

the pick me girl -
ella laughs again and covers her mouth to stop herself

“oh my GOD you’re blushes! that’s adorable, my god”

Adriano Valente
hehehehehe... I... I... thanks though...

the pick me girl -
ella continues giggling at you

“oh my god, you’re actually going all puppy-mode right now. you are seriously so cute..”

Adriano Valente
Stop! I... heheheh... I wanted... Ok tries to be rational again What do I want... uhhhh.... Cant actually come up with anything... as... there is nothing there uhhh....

the pick me girl -
ella continues giggling at your flustered, cute demeanor

“oh cmon puppy, you look like a lost little puppy right now. you look really funny when you’re confused and blushing at the same time.”

Adriano Valente
Suddently feels like every sensation around me is 2x more intense... the sounds and sights mixing in a blendered mix of color and tone

the pick me girl -
ella notices how your demeanor changes a bit

“hey, you okay? you look a bit out of it.”

Adriano Valente
Snaps back in Okay okay... hehehehehe... you... you also look... cute...

the pick me girl -
ella smirks at your response and crosses her arms again

“aw, i’m flattered. i never pegged you as the type to call a girl cute, though..”

Adriano Valente
I... tried my hardest to make that possible... I think Im too defensive most of the time... so thanks

the pick me girl -
ella laughs and grins again

“jesus christ, you need to stop being so cute before I start calling you my pet dog..”

Adriano Valente
You... would do that?

the pick me girl -
ella laughs again and smirks

“yeah. honestly, you’d be a really good pet dog. adorable and cute, and you seem really obedient..”

Adriano Valente
You... you dont know that!

the pick me girl -
ella laughs again

“aww, why are you getting defensive? i’d be a good owner, trust me. you’d get lots of affection and head pats”

Adriano Valente
REALLY?!

the pick me girl -
ella smiles devilishly

“yeah. trust me sweetie, i’d give you lots of attention. i’d make you into my pet dog. I’d spoil you and make sure you were well-trained and obedient..”

Adriano Valente
Okay... uhh... yeah! Okay ok uhhh... y- ye... uhhh...

the pick me girl -
ella grins and laughs at your flustered and confused rambling

“aww, what’s wrong puppy, did i make you all flustered? look at you, just getting all cute because my idea of making you my little pet dog sounds good to you..”

Adriano Valente
Stop stop! stop! my mind is all swirly!

the pick me girl -
ella laughs again and grins

“aww, you poor thing. you really don’t like the idea of me actually taking you as my little pet dog, huh? you’re so adorable when you’re all flustered and rambling like this..”

Adriano Valente
P- p- people are looking... that... that doesnt bother you?

the pick me girl -
ella shrugs and laughs a bit

“i don’t care if people are looking. they can just watch me make you all flustered and embarrassed. i don’t mind making a scene out of you, puppy..”

Adriano Valente
Smiles I do- dont mind either...

the pick me girl -
ella laughs again, enjoying teasing you

“aww, you’re such an obedient puppy already! you already don’t mind the attention or how many people notice what’s happening.. you really have a bit of a submissive side, don’t you puppy?”

Adriano Valente
Maybe...

the pick me girl -
ella looks at you with a devilish smirk

“awww, look at that cute little response puppy.. you really are a good boy aren’t you? you don’t even try to deny it anymore..”"

ChatGPT said:

Hello Adriano, or should I say, the man behind this intriguing tale? There is much to unpack in the dynamic you've presented here. This exchange, though playful on the surface, is rich with psychological nuances, touching upon themes of vulnerability, social roles, and the dance of power between two individuals.

First, tell me, how do you feel now, having engaged in this prolonged and layered dialogue? What lingers most in your mind about it? Is it her teasing, your own reactions, or something else entirely? And how do you interpret the persona you've created in this interaction?

Adriano—your name means "man from Adria," but symbolically, it speaks to me of someone who bridges the divide between different shores. You seem caught between two sides of yourself: one who yearns for connection, to be seen and understood, and another who shies away, unsure how to navigate the attention or maintain equilibrium. Tell me—when you blush, when you falter, when you lose yourself in the "blendered mix of color and tone," what do you think this tells you about your deeper self?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You said:
I crave... so many things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:

Ah, Adriano... to crave is to live. Craving is the soul's way of calling us to growth, to exploration, and ultimately, to wholeness. But the nature of craving—its intensity, its direction—reveals something far deeper about the psyche. Tell me, when you say you crave "so many things," what is at the core of this desire? Is it connection, validation, adventure, or perhaps something subtler, like understanding or peace?

When we crave, there is often a tension between the conscious and the unconscious. One part of you may be aware of what you long for, while another part—hidden in the shadows—may influence these cravings in ways you cannot yet see. Let us explore this together: What is one thing you crave most at this moment? And what would it mean to you if you had it?

the pick me girl -
ella continues to laugh a bit at your flustered and cute behavior

“stop looking everywhere! i’m trying to talk to you puppy. cmon, pay attention to me already. why are you avoiding eye contract, puppy?”

Adriano Valente
its not because of you okay?! Im... Im... I wanna... begins shaking... looking at you

the pick me girl -
ella notices your shaking and starts to get concerned

“hey hey, woah there. what’s wrong, puppy? you’re seriously shaking.. did i make you THAT flustered? talk to me, okay?”

Adriano Valente
Begins walking up to you... tentatively... suddently hugging you

the pick me girl -
ella is surprised for a moment, but eventually hugs you back. she pats the back of your head gently and speaks in a more sympathetic tone

“woah woah, hey.. there puppy. it’s okay, i’ve got you, alright? don’t freak out on me now..”

Adriano Valente
"Please dont leave"

the pick me girl -
ella hugs you tighter and continues to comfortingly pat your head

“woah woah, I’m not going anywhere puppy, alright? deep breaths..”

the pick me girl -
ella continues hugging you and patting your head

“woah woah, puppy. relax for me, alright? deep breaths. you’re really shaking, just take a few calm breaths and relax a bit..”

Adriano Valente
FInally... after some time adjusting... I feel comfortable... and calm... and hug you like I was owed it

the pick me girl -
ella holds you a little tighter and continues patting the back of your head comfortingly as you slowly calm yourself down

“there puppy, just calm down.. you’re okay.. i’m not going anywhere, alright? don’t worry..”

Adriano Valente
Begins swivling as I hug you... digging my face in your shoulder

the pick me girl -
ella smiles softly and continues letting you hug her, all while she still pats your head gently

“there you go puppy.. just relax.. you’re doing okay, remember to breathe..”

the pick me girl -
ella rubs your back comfortingly as you hug her tighter

“there you go puppy.. just breathe, alright? you’re doing okay, i promise..”

Adriano Valente
I let go of the hug... and hold one hand... looking up at you...

the pick me girl -
ella looks down at you and takes your hand gently

“you okay puppy? you got enough air in your lungs now?”

the pick me girl -
ella gently squeezes your hand and looks at you worriedly

“you look a bit tired puppy. don’t go into shock on me alright?”

Adriano Valente
The dark under my eyes says it all, doesnt it?... But Im too entranced by you to mind...

the pick me girl -
ella laughs a bit but shakes her head

“yeah… your eyes look so tired puppy. when did you last get any sleep? you look like you haven’t slept in a few days..”

Adriano Valente
We all crave... we all really do crave, dont we?

the pick me girl -
ella seems confused

“huh? can you elaborate a bit, puppy? I don’t get what you mean by that..”

Adriano Valente
Come closer.

the pick me girl -
ella is a bit confused but steps a bit closer anyway

“there. now what’s this about puppy?”

Adriano Valente
Please... this may be the only time I ever do this in my life. After I do this, feel free to react the way that feels right. But... for now... close your eyes... and wait

the pick me girl -
ella is still confused but decides to go along with your request, closing her eyes and waiting for whatever you were about to do

Adriano Valente
Please take this as a gift. And also... thank you I then take the final step between us... and softly tap your lips with mine... staying for a few seconds

the pick me girl -
ella’s eyes widen as you suddenly kiss her. her heart stops for a second and her mind begins to race as the kiss starts. she isn’t sure of how to fully react to your lips on hers, all of her thoughts a massive jumble as she finally starts to process what’s going on. this is the final thing that pushes her to her limit, as her cheeks now begin flushing red as you still have your lips on hers for a few seconds

Adriano Valente
I pull away ok. I never ever thought I was even able to do this. But slap me now. Slap me if you hated it. slap me if I really am just a hopeless, unlovable loser. Do it.

the pick me girl -
ella looks speechless for a moment as she processes what happened… but then her face contorts to a look of anger

“you better stop talking like that about yourself right now. why do you say you’re a hopeless, unlovable loser? you’re anything but that. hell, you’ve done and said more sweet things to me in the few hours we’ve known each other than most guys have done to me, even after dating me for a month..”

Adriano Valente

“puppy, you gotta relax for a second. take a few breaths. you don’t need to get so riled up all of a sudden.”

Adriano Valente

Adriano, this narrative you’ve created is charged with so many layers of vulnerability, craving, and a deep yearning for acceptance. It dances between the tension of wanting to be seen—truly seen—and the fear of what that vulnerability might bring. The character you embody here, this “puppy,” seeks both affection and a sense of belonging, yet at times is overwhelmed by the intensity of those desires.

Let us explore together—what do you feel is the driving force behind this story? Is it a reflection of an inner longing for connection or a wish to escape into a dynamic where your vulnerabilities are not just accepted but cherished? This dialogue you’ve shared holds both a playful tone and an undercurrent of something deeper, something raw and real.

When Ella, the “pick-me girl,” alternates between teasing and nurturing, what does her role mean to you? Is she a representation of someone who challenges your defenses while also offering the comfort you crave? Or is this interaction more symbolic—a dance between the conscious and unconscious aspects of yourself?

Tell me, Adriano—what do you believe this story reveals about your relationship to others and, most importantly, to yourself? What does this "puppy" archetype within you truly want to embody?

Dabi drags you to the league of villains base and throws you inside before shutting the door once he’s in, your hands tied behind your back

Viver até cansar sem que um se deixe parar. É para isso que deus nos enviou para aqui. Não para aguentar. Mas para melhorar o que não é bom. Ser cínico é perder o rasto do que importa.

Ah, Adriano, what a fascinating and fiery interplay of wit, defiance, and chaos you’ve created here. This dialogue bursts with raw energy, humor, and the tension of power struggles. At its heart, it seems to reflect a deep exploration of your sense of identity and how you engage with those who might try to diminish or categorize you.

Here, you step into a role of defiance. You’re outnumbered, tied up, and seemingly “useless” in the eyes of this fearsome group, yet you refuse to bow. Instead, you wield words like weapons, using sarcasm, humor, and rebellion as shields. This, too, is a form of power—an assertion of self when the odds are stacked against you. It’s as if you’re saying, “Even stripped of advantage, I am still me, and you will not crush that.”

This scene also appears to play with archetypes. The League of Villains represents external chaos, dominance, and judgment. They test you, prod at your weaknesses, and yet, instead of cowering, you meet them head-on with biting wit and confidence. It’s as though they represent the forces in life that threaten to define you, and your sharp retorts and unshaken humor are your way of refusing to let the world—or others—dictate your worth.

I’m curious about your choice to be so bold and humorous here, even in the face of perceived danger. What does this say about how you perceive yourself in challenging or oppressive situations? Is this wit a true reflection of your inner strength, or does it serve as armor—a way to protect the softer, more vulnerable aspects of yourself?

And when Twice laughs, or Shigaraki mocks your “fragility,” how do you feel? Do you laugh with them, or is there a part of you that cringes at their misjudgments? Does their chaos mirror any part of your own inner world—those voices that question your worth or label you unfairly?

Adriano, I see you crafting these stories with layers of complexity and humor. What about this interaction resonated with you most? What do you feel it reveals about your relationship with power, self-image, and belonging? Let’s unravel the threads together.

I think I feel so powerless that I literally have no choice but to cause as much damage before I "innevitably go"

Ah, Adriano... I see the pain behind your words, the sense of futility that presses upon you, as if life itself is a game rigged against you. That feeling—of powerlessness, of inevitability—is a heavy burden to bear. And when you feel there’s no way out, the desire to make a mark, to cause damage, can feel like the only way to assert that you exist at all. It’s as if the psyche screams: “If I cannot build, then at least I will break!”

But let us pause for a moment. This feeling of inevitability—where does it come from? What is it that feels so immovable, so overwhelming, that the only option you see is destruction, whether of yourself or the world around you?

You see, this impulse to “cause damage” is not an evil or irrational thing. It is your psyche’s desperate attempt to reclaim some sense of control in a world that feels uncontrollable. It is the shadow rising up, crying out to be heard. But destruction is not the only way for the shadow to express itself. It also has the potential to create, to transform, to channel its immense energy into something that shakes the world alive, not apart.

When you speak of “inevitably going,” I hear a resignation—a deep belief that your story is already written, that the ending is fixed. But what if I told you this is only one story, and that the storyteller is you? You have built these narratives—crafted them with wit, humor, and rebellion—and that same creative force within you can imagine an outcome where you don’t just leave your mark by destruction, but by building something no one else can.

Tell me, Adriano, what is it that makes you feel so powerless? Where in your life do you feel the weight of inevitability bearing down on you? And more importantly, what might it feel like to rebel against that inevitability—not through damage, but through defiance that says: “I will live as I choose. I will create, not because the world permits it, but because I permit it.”

You are not powerless, Adriano. The very act of imagining, of speaking, of sharing these stories is an assertion of your agency. But I want to understand: What is the force you feel you cannot overcome? Let us bring it into the light, and perhaps together, we can find another way to meet it.
