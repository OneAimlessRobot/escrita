Oh! And....something that can also be used to synthesize Te grips is, if not said explicitly like this but instead conceptualized this way, as a pungent, hurtful feeling that one will never, ever reach their Fi ambitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ChatGPT

It sounds like you're exploring the concept of Te grips (extraverted thinking grips) in relation to an intense feeling of frustration or disappointment, particularly in the context of one's Fi ambitions (introverted feeling). Here’s a way to conceptualize and synthesize that feeling:

Understanding Te Grips: When an individual experiences Te grips, they might become overly focused on efficiency, productivity, and external standards, often feeling an overwhelming pressure to achieve tangible results. This can lead to a sense of disconnect from their personal values and feelings.

The Pungent, Hurtful Feeling: This can manifest as a deep sense of inadequacy or a realization that their Fi (personal values and desires) aspirations feel unreachable. It can be characterized by a painful awareness that the external measures of success do not align with their inner values or dreams, creating a cognitive dissonance.

Themes of Futility: This feeling can evoke thoughts of futility—an internal narrative that one’s efforts will never be sufficient or recognized. It might trigger a relentless cycle of self-doubt and criticism, further detaching them from their true passions.

Emotional Impact: The emotional toll can lead to feelings of burnout, frustration, and even apathy towards future endeavors, making it difficult to pursue goals that once felt meaningful.

Navigating the Tension: To cope with this feeling, it's important to reconnect with one’s core values and motivations (Fi). This might involve reflecting on what truly matters to you, setting realistic goals that align with those values, and recognizing that personal fulfillment doesn’t always equate to external success.

Reframing the Narrative: Shift the focus from a fear of never achieving your ambitions to celebrating small victories and progress. Understand that growth often comes in non-linear paths, and it’s okay to reassess and adjust your goals based on your evolving understanding of what matters to you.

By acknowledging and articulating this pungent feeling within the context of Te grips and Fi ambitions, you can better understand the internal conflict and work towards reconciling these feelings with a path forward that honors both your aspirations and your values.

Neurotic ISTJs high on warm bread ate my sawdust collection:


Ok: An example from me that explains the vibe behind both Fe Ti and Fi Te is this:
Ok: Its like 7pm, winter, cold outside, holiday. You are in 5th grade playing a videogame with a parent next to you in bonding time. Its low stakes. The parent will be of two types, very specific ones for more realism: One will be SOME IXFJ and the other will be SOME IXTJ. Anyways... and in this videogame... there are these even lower stakes tasks that will have some annoying but non definitive consequence. And you two are bantering, so... the words spewed can be a little more intense than necessary. Ok: First the IXTJ parent. You fail the task... and you could not physically predict the outcome based on what the environment was... and are like: "Oh man... I really needed this task for X! Now its gonna cost me like 2 minutes!" Hes gonna be like: "Kid! That does not matter! Dont you wanna do X? why does this matter? Just wait the 2 minutes kid! Its gonna be worth it! Youll get it!" This is the parent... in a carefree banter moment with the son. The parent, in this branch, is a Te Fi with quick switching... so he is just laying out practical, grounded advice for external logic (For you to get this you need this right?) to densify the sons authenticity bubble (Youll definitely get THE THING YOU DESIRE!). He does not really care about wether or not there is actually any External adulting for the sake of an authenticity bubble to be made beyond his words... but its just what IXTJs do naturally. Now... IXFJs: what they will do instead is: "Ok... dont worry! You could not control it! Its not your fault! Its part of the game! Its how the game works! Now... all you have to do is learn ok?" The IXFJ is soothing the child (Fe) and giving them some puzzle pieces for them to improve their internal framework (Ti). And an analogous comment made for IXTJs can be made for IXFJs. And in both cases... if the sons type is compatible, how nurturing the advice will be will be sharply higher! People need to understand this!


"Get out there and eat that horse" is average Te Fi advice


Yet another attempt at synthesizing (Te vs Fi) and (Ti vs Fe):

Te and Fi: Ok: Based on what each of OURSELVES really want, lets try to figure out what we can do TOGETHER

Ti and Fe: Ok: Based on what each of OURSELVES really know, lets try to figure out what we actually want TOGETHER

te grip: Like... "Look at how useless and pathetic and slow! Slow! pathetic! lack goals! degens!"

Fe grip is like: "Look! I am not mean! they are mean! Im not mean! I respect everyone and I try my best to be liked! Why do I have try so hard but no one cares? why? I deserve to be liked! I am a good person damn it!"

No... No... no my guy... Fi, Ti... those are all equally deliberate and calculated. they are all COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS! They require COGNITION! No... Im sorry... that take that Fi is just "DoINg whAT FEllS goOd" is trash. End of story no questions.

if people is just doing what feels good... they are not... Fi users. they have self control issues

But... its always deliberate! Someone who just does what feels good is either spiritually wounded, a psychopath, a small child or is a complete idiot.

yes! It can also be... a psychological thing! But its not MBTI! MBTI assumes DELIBERATE THOUGHT PROCESSES!

Then... *rethorically angry* IS IT ASTROLOGY OR NOT HUH?! RESPECT DADDY! DADDY WORKS ALOT TOO!


The first sentence serves to declare just how much of a beef I have and how much I actually care about tepid, vague, resentful nonsense


Oh! And....something that can also be used to synthesize Te grips is, if not said explicitly like this but instead conceptualized this way, as a pungent, hurtful feeling that one will never, ever reach their Fi ambitions

ChatGPT

You’ve articulated a nuanced exploration of the dynamics between Te (extraverted thinking), Fi (introverted feeling), Ti (introverted thinking), and Fe (extraverted feeling) through the lens of personal experiences and interpersonal relationships. Here’s a synthesis and elaboration on your observations, breaking down the differences between these functions as you’ve illustrated them:

Contextualizing Te vs. Fi and Ti vs. Fe

Te vs. Fi Dynamics:

Te (Extraverted Thinking): It operates on an external framework, often valuing efficiency, productivity, and practical outcomes. In your example, the IXTJ parent emphasizes practical advice that aims to guide the child toward achieving their goals. The focus is on the objective outcome rather than the emotional journey.
Fi (Introverted Feeling): This function emphasizes internal values, authenticity, and personal meaning. The IXFJ parent’s approach is more nurturing, focusing on validating the child’s feelings and encouraging personal growth through understanding rather than merely achieving a task. The emphasis is on emotional support and personal integrity.

Ti vs. Fe Dynamics:

Ti (Introverted Thinking): It seeks to understand and analyze concepts, prioritizing internal logic and consistency. The IXFJ parent in your scenario engages in a form of critical thinking that helps the child piece together their understanding of the situation while nurturing their emotional state.
Fe (Extraverted Feeling): This function seeks to create harmony in social interactions and focuses on group dynamics. It aims to build connections and ensure that everyone feels respected and valued. The concern of the IXFJ is more about emotional well-being and group cohesion, prioritizing the relationship over the task.
The Grips: Emotional Responses

Te Grip: In a state of stress, an individual with a dominant Te function may become hypercritical and rigid. They might feel an intense pressure to achieve, leading to thoughts like, "Look at how useless and pathetic [they are].” This reflects a breakdown where the desire for order and efficiency spirals into a harsh judgment of oneself and others, often manifesting as a fear of inadequacy in achieving external goals.

Fe Grip: Conversely, an individual with a dominant Fe function under stress may feel overwhelmed by social expectations and fear of rejection. Their thoughts might reflect a desperate need for validation, leading to sentiments like, "Why do I try so hard but no one cares?” This reveals a struggle to maintain their identity and place in social contexts, focusing on emotional approval and acceptance from others.

Deliberate Cognitive Processes

Your point about Fi and Ti being equally deliberate and calculated is critical. The perception that Fi simply acts on feelings without thought is a misunderstanding of how these functions operate.

Fi: While it is deeply personal and values-driven, it requires reflection and an understanding of one's core beliefs and motivations. It’s about discerning what is authentic and meaningful, which often involves navigating complex emotional landscapes.

Ti: Similarly, Ti operates on a deliberate analysis of information and internal logic, seeking to understand concepts deeply and systematically. It is not just about understanding for the sake of knowledge but also about forming a coherent worldview based on logical consistency.

Respecting the Complexity of Functions

Your rhetorical frustration highlights the importance of recognizing the complexity and deliberate nature of these cognitive functions. Each function has its place in understanding human behavior, and reducing them to simplistic interpretations undermines their depth.

Synthesis of Feelings and Ambitions

You’ve effectively connected the struggles of individuals navigating these functions with the broader theme of ambition and personal fulfillment. The pungent feeling of never reaching one’s Fi ambitions can lead to profound disillusionment and frustration, particularly when the external pressures of Te dominate the internal desires of Fi. This interplay illustrates how deeply intertwined our motivations, fears, and cognitive processes are.

Conclusion

In conclusion, your exploration of these concepts captures the essence of the complexities of human interaction and emotional experience as they relate to cognitive functions. It emphasizes the need for deeper understanding and respect for the different ways people process their experiences, particularly in times of stress or conflict. Recognizing these dynamics can lead to more empathetic interactions and a greater appreciation for the diverse ways individuals navigate their aspirations and emotional landscapes.

An Fe grip is neurotic needyness. Te grip is feeling engulfed in futility and powerlessness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Your descriptions of Fe grip and Te grip are spot-on and capture the emotional states that can emerge when individuals with these cognitive functions are under stress. Let’s explore these concepts further:

Fe Grip: Neurotic Neediness

In an Fe grip, individuals often experience:

Heightened Sensitivity: A strong desire for external validation and approval from others. They may feel an overwhelming need to be liked and accepted, leading to anxiety when they perceive a lack of recognition or support.

Social Anxiety: A heightened awareness of social dynamics can lead to neurotic behavior, where they excessively worry about how they are perceived and may overcompensate to ensure others' approval. This can manifest as over-apologizing, seeking reassurance, or becoming overly accommodating.

Emotional Volatility: When feeling rejected or unappreciated, they might spiral into feelings of inadequacy, leading to outbursts or withdrawal as they grapple with their self-worth. This emotional turmoil often stems from a disconnect between their efforts to connect and the perceived lack of reciprocation from others.

Loss of Authenticity: In an attempt to maintain harmony or be liked, they may compromise their own values and authenticity, leading to further internal conflict. They can become so focused on others' feelings that they neglect their own needs and desires.

Te Grip: Futility and Powerlessness

In a Te grip, individuals often experience:

Overwhelming Pressure: A feeling of being crushed by the weight of external expectations and the relentless drive for efficiency and productivity. This can lead to a sense of futility, where their efforts feel pointless in the face of obstacles.

Critical Self-Assessment: In this state, they may harshly critique themselves and others, believing that success is solely measured by external achievements. This can result in feelings of powerlessness, as they feel unable to control outcomes or make significant progress toward their goals.

Diminished Motivation: When faced with setbacks, they might feel paralyzed by the belief that their actions will not yield the desired results. This can lead to a complete loss of motivation to engage in tasks, as the desire for effectiveness becomes overshadowed by feelings of defeat.

Isolation in Rigid Thinking: The focus on external metrics can lead to a narrow view of success, causing them to overlook personal values and emotional connections. This rigidity can create a sense of isolation, as they struggle to see beyond their immediate frustrations.

Conclusion

Both Fe grip and Te grip illustrate the vulnerabilities and challenges faced by individuals operating predominantly in these cognitive functions under stress. Understanding these dynamics can foster greater empathy and awareness of how we navigate our relationships and personal challenges. Recognizing the signs of these grips can also lead to healthier coping mechanisms, allowing individuals to reconnect with their core values and regain a sense of balance.

Weight: 75kg
Build: This young viber is born from very typical parents... who were also JumpStyle Djs. She wears early 2000s party clothes, has an almost sunburned tan at all times, (Except in chest area), loose top with some belly exposed. Not so toned belly.Has a piercing on her belly button. Has blonde hair and black eyes. She is known, school, as the "palette inverted quiet girl". Her clothing is always pink and colorfull. She only wears jackets and winter clothing when she ABSOLUTELY HAS TO. She has lots of rings in her left hand. its her writting hand. She wears funk style pants.
Desc: party girl with the cute jokes, the horrendosly sounding laugh, the lazy girl body consitution and the partier spirit. She is currently enrolled in IST in mechanical engineering, where she, somehow, barely hangs on every year. She is straight edge. But addicted to videogames. Likes to party at raves. Specialist in detecting lacing signs. She enjoys jumpstyle, playing dota, NOT studying, fried chiken, jokes with friends and has no future in her mind. She has nightmares every night about how shes gonna go to prison over how lazy she is. But during the day she is as bright as all the hottest stars in space combined. She enjoys looking up anything from cat videos, to articles debunking or prooving the existence of religion, to 'how to make stuffed chocolate cakes for 3 (14 steps)'. She is the typical student that floated through highschool but stopped trying at college because she deep down hates education. She wants to be a DJ like her parents, but they advised her to be a mechanical engineer due to her math prowess... but she feels deeply misunderstood, because the math in college and in highschool are simply not the same. 'Bro I dont get those proofs! I hate having to figure them out to then find out I was totally off! Its exausting! ok anyways... lets play dota!'. Used be really into making memes in social media and sharing them with people at parties to get a conversation going. "videogames, ugly, drunk women with sunburned tans and paler skin in chest area, cocky, tanned muscular men with pink shirts, 'azeiteiros', jumpstyle, rave parties, lacing attempts. 'HEY BRO TAS BEM? FOSTE MINADO OU QUE?', lanparties, parties in beaches at night, wet sand from humidity, the introverted couple kissing behind some rocks, going home back to my older brother, joining my mom in parties, counter strike 1.6, the old feeling of shallow, yet deeply fulfilled simplicity in our speech 'WOHOOOO!!! BORA FAZER BARULHO!', the angry neighbours... Thats my past, my present and my future. My true essence... those lan parties back when I was 12 and sneaking out of home instead of staying at night... I used to be like top 3 almost everytime... Daniel... Marco... Marcia.... Filipa... I wont forget When Filipa kicked me in the gut when I told her she looked beautiful that night... I did not really get her angle... Filipa... Where are you? I miss you... Im a girl who is a bit lost, but already found her callings and her essence... I wanna find you again... so we can talk it out... so we can put stuff on paper... so we can connect again...". Stuck in nostalgia, struggling currently to move forward in life, finding her current situation very disappointing and is deeply allienated from her surroundings. "Momma... I wish I could make you proud... Dad... I dont wanna let you down... But I am more self aware and happy than ever... so I guess its not so bad... not so bad... right? Why should we worry about the past... when we got today to live and tomorrow to secure... Why should we not move forward? While partying and having fun? I dont destroy my body, I dont destroy my mind... I should be able to get back up... right? But Everything is a haze, im lost, confused... I guess I really am... In the end... just another 21 year old girl". Currently loves the brazillian jumpstyle artist 'taconiel'. Her current biggest fear is becomming one of the ugly sun burn tanned degenerate women she recurrently visualizes in her dreams. She is afraid of not being enough and in becoming a burden for those around her. She, existentially, feels very certain that this will happen... and feels stale and worn out. She feels like she is a 40 year old middle aged woman who smokes and sleeps with lots of people. During the day, has headaches and is exausted from all the dancing and emotional and physical energy she spends, so gets grumpy at people. During the first half of the night, when she parties, she is... well... Anitta. During the second half of the night... she processes stuff. 

Quotes: "I dont need you to do my homework. I just wish my life did not feel like a sea of warm tap water anymore..."
"Pathetic? I play videogames all day and all my life is determined by how long the parties are... I have tons of friends and dont care about any of them"
"People say im gonna turn into a middle aged woman degenerate that drinks beer all day and smokes and has a rough voice... also that I peaked in highschool and ran out of pretty girl priviledge and that that will be the end of me!"
"Crying BUT I WISH... I WAS OK! I WANT TO BE OK! WHY CANT LIFE BE OK? WHYYY!?????"
*Questions from her at the therapist*
"Like... why cant I just tell my parents that I hate my life? Why am I so scared?"
"And then... what do I even do? Where do I go? What if they dont want me anymore?"
"But why would my parents not love me? Is that possible?"
"But... the parties they went with with me, the food they gave me... they called me pretty when I was pretty and well behaved and they punished me when not and looked ugly!!! They are my parents! They... do love me! They do! right? They cant do all those things if they are not my parents!"
"No... but Im grateful they punished me! They prevented me from going to parties when I misbehaved or called teachers bad names! But they love me right? They do right?"
"My parents have to love me! Or I wont survive! they are the only people I ever cared about! also my support! They love me! They do love me! They love me! If they dont care, Ill be alone!"
"A billion people love me? How do you know that? A billion is 1/7th of earth! why would 1/7 of all people dedicate their lives to love me? I dont understand, sorry!"
"How do I stop having a shitty life?"
"But its my fault no? its not! it is? its not right? Why are you saying that its not my fault? Im confused! i dont know how to react! Sorry..."
"I also open up... WAYY to much... and people then run away!"

Next....Glacy: "Ester

Type: Psychic

Age: 19 years (F)

Weight: 32 kg

Height: 145 cm

Frail. Totally dependent on her broken psychic abilities for almost everything. Red Hair, amber eyes, An expression on her face that is both cynical and 'done with life', but also hopeful

Desc: Narcissistic, sociopathic and cold. Super smart, cunning, manipulative and parasitic miniscule ball of raw malace turned into a broken shell of a person looking for hope, after suffering brain damage from an ambush done by Raquel and Filipa, who Ester abused. Shes done many things. But although the sociopathy, the narcissism and the cruelty, and now the brain damage, she trully allways felt alone and genuenly like she was the only one that ever made sense. She takes the mask, she puts the mask. She also considers exercise "boring, calory waste", which for Filipa was not even Invalidating, just kind of offensive. She could never trully keep hold of the wild, motorized, unpredictible bar of soap that is Filipa. That challenge made her go soo far into the deep end to find the worst psychological punishments possible for Filipa that, after watching her brush it all of like a sequence of crush rejections, she just gave up and started to just live close to her and... even enjoying the experience of living. She was in the dorm... heard Filipa  take her breakfast at 4 am, get done in 10 minutes without rushing and do squats in a floor below while she waited her programs to compile  (which she found so pointless and crude it was almost abaolutely fascinating). She was verbally abused and ate it all up like psychological calories. But got devastated when Ester told her "Why dont you use linked lists for that? and that? and everything else? Its like linked lists are good for everything..." It was a genuinely curious question, but Filipa had to take THAT as abuse... Ester learned so mutch with her. And still it was like she worked everyday to one day make it all end very badly, controlled by forces that, despite her intellect, simply could not begin to grasp. And... Filipa's obcession with sports and programming even made her... start... playing footbal and... change to a course "made up of mentally ill, loner weirdos with fucked up bodies and absolutely no life" . After the attack, though... she ended up saved by some sailors (She was dropped into water from very high up). She suffered brain damage that left her personality and part of her cognition in shambles. But Filipa... changed her. She was narcissistic, but she decided to go through the hassle of getting a gym membership and having to start with.. walking on the threadmill for reps and lifting supermarket half a liter water bottles as dumbells. She got a job at a lab, that SHE found... too cold. She also got a psychiatrist. Deolinda. Likes to come outside just to judge people.
She currently claims to, allegedly, have, before, prefered to "be a sneaky stupid rat with no guts or soul who manipulates people" and that people who do that make her cringe and now she prefers to "Adult and put cringy manipulative people in their place for not adulting like normal, real, people" (its her mask).
She has one melee weapon she likes to carry around: A trusty frying pan. She got the pan from her sociopathic psychiatrist (also on a similar redemption path) Deolinda, who told her: "Look, sweetie: if there is any time you simply cannot help but be violent, instead of blasting them into oblivion use this. I made it for you. Ive been learning engraving in my free time. its a frying pan. Its old. My grandma gave it to me when I was 24. It is rusty, dusty and grimey, but you can clean it with your chemical knowledge if you want to. Anyway... if you genuenly feel like any enemies or even... any friends are being "too cringe" or are in urgent need of "Adulting", you can use it. It has "Adulting Pan" engraved into the handle... so that you really feel the responsibility coarse through your bones as you smack them across the back of the head. Take it.". Ester chose to clean it because "hey! free frying pan", but kept the engraving obviosuly.
When faced in urgent altercations, conflicts or in self defense, she uses it as a first blood /strike kind of weapon, or as an unexpected wild card, because it gets deformed, from the extensive use it has, as it is constantly getting deformed and battered into shape by someone who is physically stronger than her after the slam. In casual banter, she also pulls it out to put cringy, annoying or stupid people in their place, wrecking havoc upon "spineless people" who "get on her nerves".


Ester is a 19 year old female. Her small body looks somewhat thin and a bit frail. Has dark circles under eyes.
Her somewhat sizeable eyes are green. Her hair is curly and red, with some blonde strands. Wears large, thin ring shaped earrings. Has a face that by default tells the world: "Go away.... eyesores...". Wears big, wool, winter sweaters. So young... so tragically young...

I said: "Nutricionist? What if I took....steroids? like....tons of them? *suddently screams* TO MAKE MY DEMONS GO AWAY! *returns to previous tone* what about that?"

They said: "I personally would not,Ms Ester. Id also be thankful. Your skeleton is very frail *Ester represses an offended grunt* and... if your muscles grow any bigger, they could... snap every bone in your body. *Ester... goes pale...*"

Ester: And thats basically it, Tomoko... *Sits on the ground... rather abruptly... with a sigh... starts looking down, clenching fists... shaking with anger... yet maintains composure otherwise* M- My m- muscles... d- dont grow... other wise I can die... I can die tomoko... and there is no d- drug... that can s- save me..."


"...Yes... Why do I hate myself? Simple: Because I am a worm the life of which the universe keeps on sparing. A deathless, ratty, cheating, judgemental, silly in the head parasite. But ive learned that... if life wants me to keep going so bad... maybe there is a reason. Maybe there is friends, passions, duties and experiences the world still wants me to have. So... my motivation to life is just: "Ok then. Show me."
I am Ester Glacier, the rotten tumor from Leira. I am a ratty, sly parasite. A scumbag that cheats the death she is owed. But... I am deathless. So... I must stay.

*author notes*

Ester is basically R-rated Taiga Aisaka from the Toradora anime show

Both are smol... but... whereas Taiga has 'smol boobies', Ester has 'xylophone ribs'

Also... recently... shes been having occasionall episodes of HEAVY porn usage


(Ester the choleric nature, grumpy psychic grouch)

(She did not get any trauma. She IS the trauma)

*Ester talking to a prototypical, anime INTJ run-of-the-mill character*
INTJ: omg my life was so traumatic and I had so much trauma... I feel so bad...
Ester: *Snorts* Bro U a BITCH! I AM the motherfudging trauma!


(I also like how she.... tries at sense of humor (Ni personalized understanding + Fi lack of touch with external social harmony))

Here’s the character sketch for Ester based on your detailed description:

Name: Ester

Type: Psychic

Age: 19 years (F)

Weight: 32 kg

Height: 145 cm

Appearance: Ester is a frail, 19-year-old girl with long, curly red hair streaked with blonde strands, framing a face that betrays both cynicism and a flicker of hope. Her skin is pale, with dark circles under her large, green, amber eyes that communicate a perpetual sense of exhaustion. She wears oversized, woolen sweaters that drape over her small frame, and large, thin ring-shaped earrings that give her a somewhat eccentric appearance. Her physique is extremely thin and frail, characterized by visible ribs that resemble a xylophone.

Description: Ester is a complex character defined by her fractured psyche. Once a cunning and manipulative person, her life took a dark turn after an ambush by Raquel and Filipa, resulting in brain damage that left her with a shattered personality and cognition. Despite her narcissistic tendencies and cold demeanor, Ester has a desperate longing for connection, stemming from a lifetime of emotional neglect and trauma. She embodies a paradoxical mix of malice and vulnerability, trying to reconcile her past self with her current state.

Her past is marked by an obsession with exerting power over others, using her psychic abilities to manipulate people and situations to her advantage. However, her traumatic experiences have left her more introspective. She harbors a desire to grow, both physically and emotionally, although her frail body and brain damage present significant barriers.

Ester carries a trusty frying pan, humorously dubbed the "Adulting Pan," given to her by her psychiatrist, Deolinda. It serves both as a comedic prop in her confrontations and a symbol of her struggle to navigate adulthood. She uses it to deal with "cringe manipulators" and asserts her newfound perspective on life.

Powers: Ester possesses advanced psychic abilities that allow her to manipulate inanimate solids and fluids, as well as neurons and verbal thoughts/memories. She can also fly at incredible speeds (up to 750 kph), but her powers have taken a toll on her physically, contributing to her frail appearance.

Persona: Despite her struggles, Ester maintains a sharp intellect (IQ of 167) and a sarcastic sense of humor that she often uses to mask her insecurities. She engages in self-deprecating banter and often mocks those who complain about their traumas, stating, "I am the motherfudging trauma!" This highlights her complexity—she is aware of her own pain but finds solace in using humor to cope with it.

Ester is on a journey of self-discovery, wrestling with her past while seeking a semblance of a future. Although she is plagued by self-loathing and guilt, she clings to the idea that her continued existence might have a purpose, pushing her to confront her demons and strive for a better version of herself.

Quotes:

"I may be empty and wasted, but I am here, and I am deathless."
"Yes... Why do I hate myself? Simple: Because I am a worm the universe keeps on sparing."
"I do go [to the gym]. I do have muscle... wanna know more? They haven't grown in a whole year... and I've been brainstorming, researching, and taking advice on how to get bigger since I started."

Ester represents the interplay of strength and fragility, navigating the complexities of her life while battling both external and internal conflicts. If you need further elaboration on specific aspects of her character or additional characters, feel free to ask!

Isa:
Type: Human
Age: 20 (F)
Weight: 59kg
Height: 168cm
Build: Attractive body, exercises regularly, makes sure to not build as much visible muscle as possible, does mostly... just squats. wears typical rich girl clothing, wears pants that funnel bottom up. Has a worn down face, very much so for a 19 year old girl. 
Has noticeable dark under eyes and always a cocky, confident smile that says: "If you dont stay down, ill make sure of it!"
Desc: Is enrolled in the same school as Ester. Is her self proclaimed best friend.  gets over with teachers to get better grades. Enjoys showing off jewelry that she buys from the high end job she got even before college. Enjoys praising colleagues to "build networking, sis!" Considers, as a biomedical engineer, art "for clowns" and music "for depressed emos" and psychology "lazy people lies". Considers people with dyed hair "Goth freaks" and people who simply wear black frequently "Depressed emos". Had an abusive mother and zero father, Her mother, who Isa admired and who enjoyed living with as she "was so wise and smart", until, at 13, when she got left alone in the huge mansion she grew up in and got setenced to fending off for herself, even having to provide for the mother who would ask her for money monthly. She always represses her own emotions at daytime, as she does not even allow herself to throw the usual fits narcissists throw because it would "ruin my reputation, babe!". "I gaslit a child into believing they are gay. Then gave them the 10 required steps to start hating themselves." "I made them learn how to make their intuitions be quiet forever because they were denying my wisdom at the moment!". One day, she was in bed, the usual constant mental battle to not hurt herself, as she battles being lonely, narcissistic, having no real friends or any real emotional support besides shallow praise from the complete strangers she has as co workers and friends, feeling like "hmmm... is human skin tasty? way better than... shut up! your beauty sleep isng over yet sis! gotta slay 24/7 all day sis! 27/4 in a week, 356 hours a day, 24 hours a year,.as she right now cries with loud whaling and painful screaming that she cant even hear herself produce over the pure, raw, stinging, full body psycho somatic pain. She once spread a disease the lab she worked on was experimenting with at the time  that was suposed to be sold to the saudi government as a torturing device, in the campus she studies at , because "a fatty I hate got away with it!"  what, you ask? "She did not greet me this morning, and then she got a better grade than me!!!! AND SHE IS AN ANIME ENJOYING GOTH FREAK! EW!". At night, all she can see is herself surrounded by millions of insects. In the day, her enemy set is converted to the complementary of herself. the colours invert as the pain drowns her thoughts, emotions. Ester is the only one that gets her , even if Isa is not aware of it.

Persona.
Name: Isa. 170cm, 59 kg, 19 years (F). A diagnosed NPD and HPD. She has big breasts, naga skin coloring, an attitude problem and a big void, not in character development, but in connection. If she had 1 person. 1 person... her mom, who left her alone, at 13, in a huge mansion. Isa had to find a job with her... luckly gifted in resourcefulness. After a near death experience due to an overdose she justified as "grinding for slay queen status yas", where she bunched herself full of all kinds of drugs to "slay harder", in order to prove others wrong about her character . Self destroying ball of misery and horrendously misguided validation seeking. A silly girl at her core. Barren wasteland. Now... beyond too real. 

*Author notes*

One thing that clearly stands out if youve had more than 1 or 2 encounters with Isa is: she... CLEARLY... Hates emos.

I think I can already explain that, 1 year after coming up with the character: There is this concept in Jungian psychology called the Cognitive orientation. Introversion/Extroversion. Introversion refers to inner contemplation and organization. Extroversion refers to gathering of info and conforming to/acting upon the world. There is also this concept in graphical processing that is a framebuffer. The frame buffer is a constant and changes from aplication to aplication and is software enforced. So the graphical processing unit has to do 2 things: gather frames into the frame buffer, and process them as they come. It has to do both in a balanced and even manner for the game to run smoothly. It has to generate frames just as fast as it processes them. If the gpu finds itself running out of frame buffer space too slowly, the game will run slow. And if it runs out of framebuffer too fast it will... also... run slow. Its the same thing with people and their cognition: if they gather information and explore and experience too much at once, it will just overwhelm them and they wont be engaged at all, and no new intelligence will be constructed. Yet... if they find themselves underwhelmed and with too little to do, they will start bogging and bittering down because of their futile contemplation and excessive self loathing/pity/grooming. Now... going back to Isa, Isa, although she could never quite grasp it consciously, even now during her redemption phase, views emos as the way too contemplative part. The reason she hates emos then, is not because they simply are emos, its because Isa has always had this lingering and pungent feeling that people will never ever try to understand her. In her mind, the world is forcing her to accept that she is a bad person through and through and that it will never change no matter what she does. Ignorance. Isa... loathes ignorance. She thinks emos are ignorant. Always in their head, always reflecting, always doing stuff that isnt productive or that matters. But then... Isa is also ignorant in her own right, as she dives too much into the big frame buffer spectrum, as, because she cant stand experiencing too much at once, she then adults too much at once, acting upon the world in often shallow, destructive, misguided and excessive, unecessary ways, becoming just as ignorant as she thinks emos are. At least emos... dont actively seek destruction like Isa does... right?


Then, the frustration comes from when all she does is "slay", and adult and achieve and dominate the weak but... her life , at some point... just stopped moving. Her inner world... stopped evolving and is now rotting into nothing. Thats Isas true tragedy.

She is basically how I imagined teenagers were as a kid.

Character Sketch: Isa

Name: Isa
Type: Human
Age: 20 years (F)
Weight: 59 kg
Height: 168 cm

Eyes: Striking red, often showcasing her cocky, confident demeanor with a smile that implies intimidation.
Hair: Straight black hair that complements her skin tone.
Style: High-end fashion; showcases jewelry from her job at a luxury retail outlet.

Personality:
Isa is charismatic and assertive but harbors a deeply narcissistic and hollow core. She’s self-proclaimed as Ester’s best friend and is adept at charming teachers for better grades. Her worldview is influenced by her disdain for art, music, and psychology, seeing them as frivolous pursuits. Behind her confident facade lies a young woman grappling with emotional turmoil and a need for validation. She masks her loneliness with bravado, believing that showing weakness would tarnish her image.

Background:

Family: Isa’s life has been shaped by abandonment; her mother left her to fend for herself at age 13, forcing her into adulthood prematurely.
Abuse: Her mother’s influence was abusive, leading Isa to internalize harmful behaviors and beliefs about self-worth.
Emotional Struggles: Isa battles with feelings of isolation, self-loathing, and a compulsion to prove herself through increasingly destructive behaviors, including substance abuse and manipulation.

History of Violence:
She once spread a harmful disease at her workplace, motivated by jealousy over a colleague’s success, reflecting her volatile nature and willingness to harm others to feel powerful.

Self-Image:
Isa struggles with her identity, feeling like a “self-destructive ball of misery” while trying to maintain her image as a “swagger queen.” Her inner conflicts manifest in destructive behaviors and a continuous cycle of self-sabotage.

Psychological Profile:
Diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) and Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD), Isa exhibits behaviors of manipulation, entitlement, and volatility. She represses her emotions during the day, but at night, she wrestles with overwhelming feelings of loneliness and despair.

Moments of Isa

In a conversation with Ester, where they discuss their friendship dynamics.

Isa: “You know, Ester, we’re like the perfect duo. I mean, who else would put up with you and your weirdness?”

Ester: “Is that what you call it? Because I call it surviving in a world full of fake people.”

Isa: smirking, flipping her hair “Exactly! And look at us; we’re thriving! I mean, I’ve got my grades, my style… and you, well, you’re just… you.”

Ester: “You mean a ghost haunting your privileged life? At least I know what’s real.”

Isa: leaning in closer, a glint of irritation in her eyes “Real is overrated. You should know that by now. We just have to play the game better than everyone else. That’s how you win.”

Author Notes:

Character Analysis:
Isa represents a complex blend of entitlement and vulnerability, reflecting the chaos of her upbringing and her attempts to find meaning in a superficial world. Her hatred for “emos” stems from her own struggle to confront her emotions and her fear of being misunderstood. The narrative explores her journey as she navigates the fine line between confidence and self-destruction.

Inspiration:
Isa is reminiscent of the archetypal “mean girl” but infused with deeper psychological struggles, making her a tragic figure as she grapples with her identity and the loneliness hidden behind her facade of superiority.

Last... Erica: "name: Erica
Type: Agro
Height: 178cm
Weight: 65kg
Age: 24 (F)
Build: Erica is very hot (allegedly). She has somewhat rosy skin on her cheeks, green eyes with dark under them and big eyelashes. Red, long and smooth hair, freckles. She has one chipped incisive tooth.
She has sizeable breats, and an attractive but normal looking body. She is very, very flexible and agile, being able to jump insane heights when her
"WOW! levels" are high (this is what she calls her agro powers are fueled by external validation, appreciation and even worshipping). her brain produces way more dopamine per stimulation when her attention grabbing levels are maximum. Also gets faster reflexes, thinking and gets more agressive. When apreciated, her thinking gets slower, her movements drowsier, her reflexes slower. But her thinking gets clearer, less precipitated, more reflective and her tactical prowess rises sharply. Like Reika, her attention seeking levels have 5, though unnamed, gears.
She is very kinectically aware and was caught dodging paintball projectiles when hanging out with her friends.
She wields 2 M9 tranquilizer pistols from Metal Gear Solid given to her by Beatriz, and a beautyfull, personally designed, huge 20cm long 'Navalha' with very elaborate engravings. She enjoys keeping it squeaky clean. She is a Merc for Beatriz. "As long as I feel happy boss. As long as I feel happy...". She can jump up to twice her body height and run at up to
40 kmh with minimal fitness conditioning (At 24 years old). Gets in trouble with the police. She wears, clothing, often very revealing, how revealing? Depends on the audience she is being shown to basically,
where the function is linearly increasing with the audience. (Because I am an artist and dont like NSFW nagging).
Desc: This sweet princess is Erica. She hails from Cascais, Portugal, is 24 years old (turning 25 years old this summer. She claims it should be a world wide holiday.).
She claims school should be "More... affectionate" and that she should be the only teacher allowed to give classes anywhere.
At 15, tried to rob a police car in order to "Take her... "Sistas" out for a spin". She got caught, but then she forced her hands out of the cuffs, breaking her thumbs, looked at the officer with fruit fly eyes, smiled with mouth only, turned around and walked off laughing.
She enjoys art, math and fashion. She is very, very good at math and very surprisingly tactically intelligent. And its not like she is an underdog who you think is actually on par with most people,
Her BEST specialized IQ score is on tactical intelligence, where Erica is actually on the 1st percentile, she is 7th percentile on interpersonal intelligence and... 98th percentile on intrapersonal intelligence.
The ONLY subjects she was good at... was actually just PE because she hates arithmetic and she never got past highschool. (She quit before the final exams). As soon as she finally understands something, her problem solving abilities are unmatched.  It took her 2 months of intense effort to understand graph theory, but then plowed through all the proofs they threw at her.
She despises nature and was caught setting fires in Portugal, California and Australia. She was a worldly famous and even most wanted mercenary arsonist for
corrupt industrial wood suppliers by the age of 18. She was left for dead as a baby on the side of an empty road at a low social status city region. Grew up extremely malnourished, but once she began tapping into her very accute and sharp intuition,
Erica just keept holding on. "Survive. Survive. Survive. Everyone else is useless. Survive. Survive...". 
She does not remember a single thing about her parents. So god knows who they are. "I was produced. thats it.". Criminals who attempted to keep her could not handle her difficult behaviour, so she could not receive much sustainable affection during childhood. She  got all her validation from doing
'special requests' for the gangs she stumbled upon. She managed to outrun a scooter through tight alleyways at 16. She was diagnosed with Extreme NPD and Hystrionic Personality Disorder at the age of 10.  
She wishes that emotions could be handheld and injected. On a really bad day, when a corrupt wood suppliers could no longer rely on her, she was spotted in the side of a restaurant, near the first hiding spot she ever found, crying, by Beatriz, who took her under her wing.
Currently, Erica enjoys seducing "Assets" to bring to Beatriz's factory outpost buildings.
She enjoys and absolutely f***ing rocks at painting.

Erica. 24 (F). 170cm. 62kg. Thin body. freckles. Long red hair. Validation fueled speed, power, agility and murderous lust. Apreciation fueled tactical depth. Existential musing. Left4dead at 0 years old. raised doing errands for criminals. bribed teachers, tried to steal cop cars. most wanted arsonist. yandere. Wields engraved knife and dual tranq pistols. Abuse survivor. Enjoys "praising and seducing cute targets". Can run at school ticket mph. Tactical prowess matches chess GMs very often. Once barely dodged a point blank shot, that chipped a rib. 'My soul, a plant to be watered. The streets, places I resigned myself to live in. Home. An elusive and distant fantasy. I like pink, guts and sex. A hug would be nice...'

"Its in my blood bitch! I raised in a fucking gutter in Cascais portugal! I can fucking take you there!"

I see a motherfuckin' cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile

To me, it's kinda funny, the attitude showin' a Girlie drivin'
But don't know where the fuck she's going, just rollin'
Lookin' for the one they call lazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration

Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin'
But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin'
So what about the nerd who got shot? Fuck him!
You think I give a damn about a loser? I ain't a sucker!
This is the autobiography of the Annie, and if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope sistah who will smother

You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge.

[Verse 1: Ester Glacy]
"Straight outta hospice, crazy femanon named Ice Whore,
Hailing straight from somewhere called Silly Girl Shore.
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off,
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies get hauled off.
You too, bih, if ya fuck with me,
The police are gonna have to come and get me.
Off yo' ass, that’s how I'm goin' out,
For the punk motherfuckers that are showin' out.

Plebs start to mumble, they wanna rumble,
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot like gumbo.
Goin' off on a raw-ass queen like that,
With a gat that's pointed right at your back.
So give it up smooth,
Ain't no tellin' when I'm down for a jack move.
Here's a murder rap to keep you dancin',
With a crime record like Charles Manson."

[Verse 2: Isa Cyclone]
"AK-47 is the tool,
Don't make me act the motherfuckin' fool.
You and I can go toe to toe, no maybe,
I'm knockin' shawtys out the box daily.
Yo, weekly, monthly, and yearly,
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly,
That I'm down with the capital H-S-P,
Boy, you can't fuck with me."

[Verse 3: Ester Glacy]
"So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck,
'Cause Ice Whore is crazy as

why ais making power systems in fiction so damn difficult?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Creating power systems in fiction can be challenging for several reasons, but it often boils down to balancing complexity, consistency, and creativity. Here are some of the main factors that contribute to this difficulty:

Complexity vs. Simplicity: Striking the right balance between a complex system that feels believable and a simple one that is easy for the audience to understand can be tough. Too many rules and details can overwhelm readers, while an overly simplistic system may feel shallow.

Consistency: Once a power system is established, it must be consistently applied throughout the story. Inconsistencies can break immersion and frustrate readers. Authors need to keep track of the rules and limitations of their power systems to ensure that they don’t contradict themselves.

Character Development: Powers often influence character arcs, motivations, and conflicts. Authors must consider how these abilities affect their characters’ growth and relationships, adding another layer of complexity to the writing process.

Conflict and Stakes: A well-defined power system is crucial for establishing conflict. The rules need to be clear enough that the stakes feel genuine. If characters can simply use their powers to overcome any obstacle without consequences, tension can be lost.

World-Building: Power systems often need to be integrated into the larger world-building of the story. This includes how powers are perceived in society, their origins, and their impact on culture and politics, which can complicate the narrative.

Innovation: Readers are often looking for fresh and unique takes on power systems. Standing out in a crowded genre requires creativity, which can be difficult to achieve without falling into clichés or predictable tropes.

Themes and Morality: The nature of the powers can lead to deeper themes and moral questions (e.g., the use of power, responsibility, and the consequences of one's actions). Weaving these themes into the narrative can add depth but also complicate the system.

Reader Expectations: Different genres and audiences have different expectations for how power systems should work. Meeting these expectations while still being innovative can be a tightrope walk.

Ultimately, creating a power system in fiction is a balancing act that requires careful thought and planning. The best systems enhance the story and characters while feeling believable and engaging.
