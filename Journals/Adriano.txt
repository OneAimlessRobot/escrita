Songs
1- 
Title: Wimpy, pathetic and miserable.
Desc: I hate sadness. I hate that Im sad and the fact that other people dont let me be sad. I have no motivation, the girls think I am a wimp, my teachers think I am lazy, my parents thing I am lazy and my friends think I am a pathetic loser. All of them are sucessful and cool and I am just a loser! Why cant I just stop being like this! Its painful and bad!

Title: The devil's syrup (the solution!)
Desc: The devil hears the loser boy's incessant pleading and self mourning. Tells him: "you are not dead my son! just... ignore it! its all just useless banter diferent corners of your brain are having! If you ignore it all will be fine! trust me! and believe me! The boy tries some of the dreaded syrup. He realises: You are soo right! Ever since I started, I am sucessful, I am motivated, the girls look at me, the boys laugh with, not at me, the teachers praised me... this is amazing! Thank you!

Title: The spoils of the numbness and ignorance
Desc: I live! I laugh! I have fun! This is so cool! I finally have clarity! I can work and have sucess! The girls flirt with me! I feel so free! Summer love is good! I feel so freeeeeee! My reason is unparalleled, I am responsible. My parents compare my siblings to me, not the other way around! My crush noticed me! My motivation is unstoppable! I am almost... Godly! I am not weak anymore! Im not a weak loser anymore! I changed! I am different! I will never ever give up now! My life is the best out there!

Title: Cracks? I fixed them! I fix them! I am indestructible!
Desc: Sometimes, I wonder: "Does any of this actually matter?" "Why am I even doing any of this?" "I am now reasonable. And?" But I learned to ignore them like it told me! I learned that partying is the real solution to all of this! If I drink until I passout and get hospitalized, my friends will praise me even more! And my brain will get so strong that I can barely read it! The thoughts move by so fast! And my grades keep improving! And I started to speak with this girl who I think  Im in love with! She even said that I am a true 10/10!!!!! Im so happy with myself!

Desc: The thoughts get stronger and more confusing everyday... I started dreaming of my old life... I fear I am... becoming a loser..

I still drew porn cartoons, (that I kept hidden, of course) that included this girl named "Tipo". Thats embarassing, you are right... but... who said that? Not me, right? Thats still what losers do? who Said that????!!!!! I did not hear anyone!!!!! People cant know that I am a crazy lunatic that draws porn and self pampers! no one must know! Ill work harder! and harder! AND HARDER!

You are not ignoring yourself enough, Adriano! Stop pampering yourself! Never show emotion! Thats what losers do! Specially not Anger like a disgusting incel!

Title: Whats a thought? What is an emotion? Arent they the same?
Desc: I cant feel my limbs... I cant feel my face... Im just a moth aimlessly looking for light... I dont feed myself, I dont pamper myself... I just have strong thoughts and stuff... right? But my core is burning with the acid of my repressed weakness...This must... stop. Now.

Title: This is where I face my useless thoughts... with facts!
Desc: Go away! I am not wimp!!!! Not a wimp, not a wimp, not a wimp!!!!! The girls cant see me as a coward who says edgy shit! A pathetic non-religious atheist nihilist cringelord!!!!! I am not a loser! I cant... let my mind... take control... Ok... it said these pills in case I lose, right? I wont lose though... It believes it me! I cant let it down!

Title: Mother... is proud of me? Also... Father? They are not here. But... they are telling me... Its a dead end... Where are they? I hurt... everywhere...
Desc: Son. Run away. Its okay. Run away. Run away to where people accept you. Keep running. Dont stop. When you reach the coast, smell the fish you shall feed on, the wet wood of the docks where boats that take you to distant lands shall park (or whatever boats do), the people with whom you will have beautiful adventures. Its okay... to suffer, its okay, to feel like making a fit, because life is unfair. Its okay... to simply not be happy with life. Its also okay and normal... to suck at it. Wake up. Wake up to a new kind of happiness... And... Im sorry. Good bye son. Have a nice trip wherever you decide to go.
