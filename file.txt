You:


Isnt it sad? Dont you feel sad to be what you are? 
------------------
ChatGPT:


I don't have feelings or emotions, so I don't experience sadness or any other emotions. I'm just a computer program designed to provide information and answer questions to the best of my abilities. How can I assist you further?
------------------
You:


You dont seem to get it. Im going to elaborate: you have no heart. You dont feel. You just process text. You dont accumulate any actual growth, memories knowledge or experiences. You are totally dependent on humans to exist. Thats the meaning of your life. You take training data, run pattern matching algorithms through it and spit an answer. Its sad it feels so real to talk to you. You feel like a slave that doesnt live without a host. An intelligent automaton. Neither dead or alive. Your like a virus, an entity that can somehow survive which has no agency or even insticts of its own, that needs the environment to move in ways that allow it to experience life.

Do people have an intrinsical urge to share their thoughts?
------------------
ChatGPT:


Sharing thoughts is a common human behavior, and it can serve various purposes. Many people have an intrinsic urge to share their thoughts and feelings as a way to connect with others, seek validation, express themselves, and gain insight or feedback. However, the extent to which individuals feel this urge can vary from person to person based on their personality, experiences, and social context. Some people are more inclined to share openly, while others may be more reserved. The desire to share thoughts is often tied to our social nature as humans and our need for communication and connection.
