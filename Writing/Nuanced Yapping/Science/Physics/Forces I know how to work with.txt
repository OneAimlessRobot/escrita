Forces from classical mechanics I know how to work with:

Restitution force:

Force applied on a body stuck to a spring, stuck to a wall, that obbeys hookes law:

x is the body's displacement relative to the balance point

k is a constant from the spring that defines its restitution coefficient in Force per meter

F_rest = -k*x


Universal gravitation:

Intensity of a passive, contactless force suffered by two bodies which have mass:

(G is the gravitational constant)
(m1 is body 1s mass. Analogous with m2)
(r is the distance between them)

F_g = G * ((m1* m2)/(r*r))

Coulombs law:

Intensity of a passive, contactless force suffered by two bodies which have electrical charge:

(k is the coulombs constant)
(q1 is body 1s charge. Analogous with q2)
(r is the distance between them)

F_e = k * ((|q1* q2|)/(r*r))



Force suffered by a body travelling through a fluid.

(p is the density of the  fluid)
(A is the total Area exposed to the fluid in the immediate direction of travel of the fluid relative to the body)
(Cd is a kind of constant of aerodynamic efficiency, determined empirically, related to the body's shape)
{(Vb is the velocity of the body)
(Vf is the component of the velocity of the fluid paralel to the body's movement)} <-- signs can be different


F_d = -1* 0.5 * p * A * Cd * ( (Vb-Vf)^2)


Forces of contact resistance:

Static resistance - sr
Kinectic resistance - kr


sr - The force required to change a body's kinectic energy from a standstill. Only makes sense when body has null velocity

kr - The force required to increase or maintain the kinetic energy of a body. Only makes sense when body has non-null velocity

both act only when a body is in contact with a surface and they depend on:


- A constant: c, empirically determined, that is a kind of friction coefficient between the surface underneath the body and the surface over the rugged ground

its called csr with static and ckr with kinetic

And the normal force that is being produced from the body being forced into the ground

F_sr = N * sr

F_kr = N * kr


Both always oppose the body's movement.

F_kr turns into F_sr when the body stops and F_sr turns into F_kr when the F_sr is surpassed. 

The body's velocity wont get off null as long as F_sr is not surpassed


Force acting on a body immersed by a fluid:


It depends on:

P- The pressure the fluid is at
A- The area of contact between the body and the fluid

F = P * A



Intensity of Centripetal force:


The force acting on bodies that experience Constant circular motion:

Here... the speed vector has constant length... but its direction
changes by some angle per unit of time

it depends:

On the body's mass - m
On the angular acceleration it is being subjected to 
On the modulus of the speed vector - v


The aceleration, atp every point, is perpendicular to the speed vector and is also constant

Per second... the speed change is.....
ok:
v-> = (vx,vy)
(vx,vy)* (g,c) = 0 <-> vx*g + vy*c =0 <-> vx*g = -vy*c <-> g =( -vy*c )/vx

a->=(-vy/vx,1)*(1/||v->||)*(||F_cen||/m)




(vx, vy) ms + (
