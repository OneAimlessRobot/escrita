Psychology roasts:


What if I am just looking for accuracy? And also willing to point out weaknesses AND strengths? By the way I never went to a doctor. I just said I was a narcissist to be invalidated on purpose. Narcissism does not have traits. Until you start understanding, Western psychology wont ever go beyond tepid.

Because I could simply be displaying lots of honesty and self confidence... psychology does not have a clue of what its doing


And sometimes people simply have ideological enemies (which is normal and okai. Enemies are good! People who just come up to you to humble yo ass... but they are not bullies ok? Its different.) in their lives and because they are pussies, label them as narcs for no reason.
