MBTI Pe cannot work without MBTI Pi and vice-versa. And its not like "You see... you are not working at your best and you could be better" Its literally like a front engined, rear wheel drive car without a driveshaft Its like a tornado that did not touch soil.
Writing to sockets without being able to read from them. Literally does not work. You always use a lil bit of each. But not at the same time. Its always the higher followed by the lower. Like an operating system scheduling between execution threads
