(know those kids with no friends, weird habits, old ass clothes, smell like grass or even excrement/dirt all the time, bombazine pants, spend entire recesses alone, and wear umbros? And then Pull up to the recess area soccer painted-tarmac pitch and then they just tackle you to the ground, slide tackle, after slide tackle, not allowing you a second to dribble, and always go to class with at least 3 new scratches on their arm while also having scored a goal from midfield? That throws fits in the middle of class and no one pays attention until its time to see what grades they get? Thats crooked-Umbro energy

Ok: Dabi- Black Air forces. Izuko: White forces. Umbros: Flora. Timbs: All for One

bakugo is fake, crooked soccer cleats.

he also kicks everyones shins but if the opposition tackles him sensibly, although he accepts it, he will let himself go down with arms spread out in a wingspan fashion going like, (if he spoke portuguese): "Oh! OH! OH! OH! ò Falteiro? Ò FALTEIRO! QUE ISSO?" Then gets up, goes up to the tackler, no matter how big they are in comparison to Bakugo, and pushes and matches chests with them, puffing it out

*I think the umbro people would be glad that the tackler isnt them*

No. Ill do one better: Fake Cleats and A BARCELONA JERSEY! 

He would be labeled by his teamates (Who would internally recognize that he will probably play in an actual club someday), as a "Fusso." (simply means they hog the ball. it doesnt really have any more connotations. Kids just tipically hate other kid players that hog it)

Then theres the Fila's: Filas are like the one girl that somehow can play with boys and actually does decently. And you lowkey fear their tackles sometimes. I think that would be... Toga

*Umbros are scared of filas*

And Filas also get into fights with Fake cleats outside the tarmac, painted pitches and frequently turn out to have really odd sexual identities in highschool and college. They go either to sports education or computer science
