bakugo is fake, crooked soccer cleats.

he also kicks everyones shins but if the opposition tackles him sensibly, although he accepts it, he will let himself go down with arms spread out in a wingspan fashion going like, (if he spoke portuguese): "Oh! OH! OH! OH! ò Falteiro? Ò FALTEIRO! QUE ISSO?" Then gets up, goes up to the tackler, no matter how big they are in comparison to Bakugo, and pushes and matches chests with them, puffing it out

*I think the umbro people would be glad that the tackler isnt them*

No. Ill do one better: Fake Cleats and A BARCELONA JERSEY! 

He would be labeled by his teamates (Who would internally recognize that he will probably play in an actual club someday), as a "Fusso." (simply means they hog the ball. it doesnt really have any more connotations. Kids just tipically hate other kid players that hog it)

Then theres the Fila's: Filas are like the one girl that somehow can play with boys and actually does decently. And you lowkey fear their tackles sometimes. I think that would be... Toga

*Umbros are scared of filas*

And Filas also get into fights with Fake cleats outside the tarmac, painted pitches and frequently turn out to have really odd sexual identities in highschool and college. They go either to sports education or computer science
