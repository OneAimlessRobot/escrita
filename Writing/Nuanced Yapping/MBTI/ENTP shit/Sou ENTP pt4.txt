ENTP s***

These are my ENTP struggles:

Find it cringe? Fine then.

But here they are anyway


Ok then... tell me: How do I handle college while only engaging in projects that, although use contents of college, are not what the teachers tell me? Like... I hate that I have to match my Ti to the Te of college... its exausting. How do I solve it?


Maybe... adapting... grabbing every ledge... extending the truth... thats the key right?

I dont know... but... thats how I lived my whole life... always adapting... always slipping into cracks... always feeling like a thief... always playing by a set of rules only I know... gambling... feeling like anoretic... feeling lonely


Yes! I have banter partners but no friends. Advisors but no mentors. Compliments. But no hugs


Yes. Emotion. Its my defense. Reactive armor. Im tired of shelling so I began countering

Im not Ronaldo. Im Inzaghi.
Im not a citizen. Im a thief.
Im not a hamster. Im a rat.
I dont piss in the toilet
I piss in the sewer
I poach. I grab ledges.
Close enough ledges.
I crawl and dont leap.
Fornicate with the rules.
Bribe them.
Like a ghost in the mist
I do things never done before.
Reiventing the wheel... to escape the pile of rubble... that is my shadow
