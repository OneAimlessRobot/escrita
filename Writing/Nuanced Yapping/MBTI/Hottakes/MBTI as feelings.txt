mbti judging funcs as trychotomies of states of mind/feelings:

Ti:
+++ Confusion/Clarity/Ignorance ---
Fi: 
+++ Eagerness/Ambition/Sorrow ---
Te: 
+++ Frustration/Proactivity/Helplessness ---

Fe: 
+++ Insecurity/Connection/Loneliness ---

I wont do this for perceiving funcs.
For some reason it feels like I cant do the same for those, that it does not make sense
