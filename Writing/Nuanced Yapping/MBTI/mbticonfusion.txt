Ive figured out why MBTI is confusing!

Ive figured out something:why  Its impossible to infer someones MBTI just directly from any questions you ask them. why? Its impossible. the ego is not a container. MBTI types are ego types. the ego is not a container. its a hinge between the subconscious and the mask. No human as we understand now can make self reported inferences about their own ego. Only if they understand what I am saying. the ego cannot be directly acessed in any way
But thats not all! The ego is not the cars on the road, its not the drivers. Not the fuel on the cars. The ego is just a tollboth. A tollboth has no obligations other than modulating your information to be in the most balanced way possible... because a healthy ego is merely a betterment of the efficiency of the tollboths. A wifi repeater. Its just a door. You cant speak about the ego by itself combining mask and ego.
You logically cannot talk about the ego by itself. Because The ego is a door. And doors are never spoken of without entrances and exits.
To understand the ego, you dont look for an ego. Because then you will never find one. You look "Around" the ego. Someone who looks for the ego chases butterflies. And ends up lost. To understand the ego, One has to look to the way information flows in and out of the self and in and out of our masks. Look at the court, not the ball.
