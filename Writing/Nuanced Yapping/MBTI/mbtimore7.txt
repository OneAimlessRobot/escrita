MBTI continium

Wanna know what I figured out? Try to guess: What do all *good* snooker players' mbti's have in common?

No. Cognitive introversion. They are all introverts! Judd trump, Sullivan, Hendry, Davis, Selby... All of them are cognitive introverts! Just sitting there... pondering... thinking statically while the opponent plays... I bet they also love chess! And would have lots of trouble in playing any team sport in a non purely tactical role. Like... I cant do what they do, as an ENTP! Because... you need to be *very* confortable with being patient to be a snooker player! Its not an easy sport! 


And I SWEAR! If there isnt at least 1 confirmed ISFJ there Im ready to sell a kidney already!
