I think that, if Yakui the Maid were to get scouted into an F1 team, that team would be HAAS. Why? Because they are always on the edge, Team, drivers and fans alike, they are consistently the most contagiously chaotic, entertaining and dysfunctional team on the grid and oh! They just keep gambling on 'em oddball drivers! Just look at the drivers they have been hiring throughout the years! Romain Grosejan, (Who almost died in a horrific, fiery, brutal crash once), Kevin Magnussen (By far most agressive and calm under chaos of any post 2010 driver), Nikita Mazepin (Turned out to be a Bad driver) And Mick Schumaker! (Hes the son of Michal Schumacker himself! We must give him a chance!). Its like every decision they make is a trial by fire! 


"*...* AND HERE COMES YAKUI THE MAID DOWN THE INSIDE OF NORRIS! BOTH SCRAMBLE FOR A GOOD EXIT! YAKUI RIGHT ON LANDO'S TAI- YAKUI GETS IT! YAKUI WITH SOME OF THE MOST THRILLING RACING MOVES IVE EVER SEEN NOW CLIMBS TO 5TH PLACE! UP NEXT IS RUSSEL! CAN SHE GET A PODIUM?! *...*"

And I think the same applies to me, personally

Air head odd ball ahh driver
