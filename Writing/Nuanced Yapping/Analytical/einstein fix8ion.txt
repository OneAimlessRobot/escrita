When Einstein told us his definition of Insanity, was part of it self deprication motivated?

Because I can see him as the type of guy that when logic entails bad things, he gets obcessed and starts getting stubburn and repeating it

like... when he found out about black holes he could have gotten scared

And then, shortly after, repeated those equations over and over again, hoping stuff would just change somehow...
like bros a human there is no way he never did it I dont care what you say...
