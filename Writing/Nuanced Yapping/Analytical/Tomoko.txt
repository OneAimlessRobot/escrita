What are you, tomoko, fighting?

Just... life in general. i dont think you are really doing anything wrong...

Like... you are a fixed cognition type who likes connection and understanding. Correct?

You thrive in caution right?

You thrive on only exploring when its safe. People, I assume, disappoint you easly. You are also craving and unfulfilled. So you are careful... I mean... objectively youre not wrong in anything youre doing... either people are assholes or your caution blinded you to chances... but those are almost direct consequences of how you behave soo...


I mean... life just sucks in your end right?


So tell me: do you have regrets?

Why?

I sense a mix of unfulfillment and depression
