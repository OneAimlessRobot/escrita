The "plaguer" soccer player

Its a soccer player that is very medicine knowledgable, knows their own tolerances of their immune system, gives themselves contagious diseases and then pats opponent players in the back "for acknowledgment". The plan is for them, in theory, to get worn out over time by constant diseases. The player is sociopathic and can mask their own pain and disconfort well. Trains with the same diseases he gives other players to get stronger. Asks to come in as substitute during a late corner, when the opponents' immune systems are already worn out.
