I am Lara. I am Ignorant, yet blessed with charm. Charming yet blessed with Ignorance. I spend my whole day dazed and directionless. My life an endless whirlwind of possibilities and a whole bunch of nothing. Dead in the head, confused, confusing leaf in a hurricane of my own creation. My friends call me the 'dud but... a looker, I guess'. Me... a leaf in a hurricane. Chaotic and trepid, I bounce back and forth and side to side avoiding any kind of commitment. I learn a bit from everywhere and my friends are a bit of everything, just like me. So... after completing highschool, after that fated test day, I left to the hills. Litterally. I went to the forest, and found a nice spot... hidden from the unrelenting gaze of the sungods. Open... with a nice pile ot leaves... just like me... as if I was destined to come here just today. I lay there with my... LeafyIsHere friends! Ha! get it? get it? hehe... hehe... *sigh...* anyways... So I lay there... my forehand up to my forehead... blocking the sun from my eyes... my legs spread out and bent in a relaxed way, playing with one of my hair strands... wondering... where... it all went so... terribly wrong... I lay there... listening to cicadas singing for me, fruitflies kissing my wet skin and mosquitoes using my hair as a daycare, laying their spawn on me.
I sigh... every so often... as my ears feed the nothing inside my skull with sounds of wind... threatning to just... wash me out... from the sheer lightness of my muscles and bones. I could just... fly away. Not a single thought in my head. Just... a "silly girl" with "dumb blonde syndrome". No one knows Im here... nor ever will know that I was. All I do is float... and lay on flowers... and suck on the nectar to then move on to my next journey. All I am... is a butterfly on a daisy field. A leaf in a hurricane. Ignorance making me lightweight. While others fall beneath their suffering... I just get flailed and carried... Im just a material for sound to go through... without any processing. Im just a leaf. Just a little, small, Ignorant and tranquil leaf.
