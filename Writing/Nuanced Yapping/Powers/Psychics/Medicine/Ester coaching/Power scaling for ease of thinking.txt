(With the help of chat gpt for brain storming (Thnks for the idea of relative powerlevels bro))

Updated Benchmarks for the Hendecagon Stats:
Speed: Hawks (100). His combination of raw speed and aerial maneuverability places him at the top.
Attack: All Might (100). Still the gold standard of raw destructive power.
Defense: Kirishima (100). His Unbreakable is unparalleled.
Intelligence: Nezu (100). The ultimate tactician and strategist.
Collaboration: Izuku Midoriya (100). Inspires and unites people like no other.
Stamina: Endeavor (100). Tireless, relentless, and enduring.
Stealth: Toru Hagakure (100). Her invisibility gives her a natural edge.
Awareness: Hawks (100). His situational awareness and reflexes are unmatched.
Willpower: Izuku Midoriya (100). His resilience defines him.
Agility: Mirko (100). The most agile and combat-mobile hero in the series.


"These are the stats we make a percentage of.

(chat gpt's first take)

Stat Scaling Example: Ester vs. Benchmarks
Let's take a quick comparison:

Speed (Hawks as 100): Ester’s top speed is 752.27 kph, which is respectable but not near Hawks' extreme capabilities. Likely around 60-70.
Attack (All Might as 100): Ester's power is good but fundamentally limited by her psychic gland and body. Around 60-75 with PEDs.
Defense (Kirishima as 100): With her new armor and improved bone density, she might reach 30-40, far below Kirishima.
Intelligence (Nezu as 100): Ester could clock in around 99. Her intellect rivals Nezu's, though her practical focus is narrower.
Collaboration (Izuku as 100): Ester scores low, maybe 10-15, reflecting her independent tendencies.
Stamina (Endeavor as 100): With PEDs and increased muscle mass, she might hit 50-60, still nowhere near Endeavor’s relentless stamina.
This scaling ensures stats remain tied to the MHA world’s logic and characters.

Does this new breakdown align with your vision for the stats? Let me know!"

Thanks bro... but id change Ester's stamina to 13. Because... for me, it only seems reasonable for her stamina to be even close to a fraction of endeavours... because she carries loads of Energy bars on a bag before battle. if relying on exclusively the equivalent of 1 full stomach... id say her stamina is 13. Because its *her* unlucky number.

Compared to kirishima... with her enhanced defense and armor... id say like... 23

Compared to All Might... Her attacks are viscious and she has the armor and the studs and the uncompromosing attitude... but bro can blow up mountains! Id say... 30. But *most* characters will have a low stat when compared against *that* to be fair... even Bakugo I bet...

Intelligence is correct.

Collaboration. Correct. She does learn how to collaborate more as her journey progresses with all the multiple perspetives she has to consider.

Okay. In terms of charm... with her extremely apt social prowess and the "slay queen" reputation she always carries and embodies with style and comfort... id say she is charismatic as 3/4's of a All Might. Not for the best reasons... but she is. Ill give her like 70.

Stealth? She is good strategically... her intelligence might feed into her stealth... and she *is* physically small so... unless she is flying balls to the walls on the night sky with powers fully on with 100% white glow charging like a human sized tracer bullet... She is *very* difficult to see. She is likely mistaken for some random brat if zoomed out far enough... id give her... a solid 50

Willpower? I think she might be like... a solid 80. But like... again... she pretty much keeps going until she vomits her bowels out so... im tempted to give her a 90... but then again Izuko exists so... its a 80.

Agility? She might be the 4th runner up honestly. She might be directly behind the guy that can literally clip through walls, the girl that jumps over buildings, the literall f***ing bird and the *dark* bird. Honestly... ill give her a 73 but if you are compared against *birds*? and being able to manage sports car speeds for short bursts of time requires some serious hip movement!

Awareness? I think it may be like... behind... who... uhhh... All for One and hawks. And... thats it. She is VERY aware. Once again most of her stats will be solid values because... she is a solid hero student! Ill give her high 70 to low 80. Like... 79
