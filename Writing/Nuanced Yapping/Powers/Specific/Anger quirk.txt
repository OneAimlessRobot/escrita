Quirk idea: 

Limitless anger.
This one may seem like it is muscular when I begin explaining it, but its actually a mind/hormonal based quirk:
basically... are you aware of the natural strength boost people get when they are angry? Imagine that... it can increase indefinitely... and you get this quirk!
Basically... the natural barriers to how anrgy a person can get, as well as its hormonal and neurological effects, get erased.
The person will be able to run faster, jump higher and also take more risks.
As possible side effects, because the person eventually learns to deal with and is so used to controlling such high levels of anger that, while in a more neutral state, they will, more likely than not, be the calmest person in the room.

Its a little sketch for now.

Maybe I will get inspired in a walk I will take in a few minutes time
But this is it for now.
