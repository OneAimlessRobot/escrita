Ok now A casual convo: I gotta talk about the odd distribution of intellect in my  country(Portugal)'s reddit pages! First off we have r/portugal. Ok... nothing fancy. Basically a community managed news outlet alternative. Then we have.... ugh... r/portugueses. Basically... they represent the lumps of sweaty shit that spend too much time in their computers and potentially browse 4 chan. (Nothing bad with 4chan... Ive very recently made metaphorical ammends with the 4chan website but these portuguese young men are insufferable). they are xenophobic (I swear every 3 posts is ALWAYS, ALWAYS about either "Antonio Costa" (I know that bro sucks but stop telling everybody that turning portugal into north korea will solve your issues)), Racist (another third is *Exclusively allocated* for gypsies AND "Brazucas" aaaand complaining about said groups) and they are a bunch of politically obcessed, grouchy, mega-logical, pessimitic and cynnical losers. Then... we have r/NaBoaChavaloRetardado. They are a comedy subreddit. They are genuenly funny. Basically like r/OkayBuddyRetard but with portuguese culture inside jokes. The jokes are varied, clever and, if you are in the mood, can pretty much always make you laugh (my experience), And varied they are: They range from short but elaborate and cool narratives involving portuguese political figures that both mock and endear them to us, snappy memes, retorts about other subreddits, schizoposts and references to stuff completly unrelated to portugal that are somehow still funny and related. Although it can get kinda tiring if you *only* browse comedy subreddits. Then there is r/PORTUGALCARALHO That is trying wayyy too hard to be like r/NaBoaChavaloRetardado and repeats the exact same jokes every time. But them... there is r/CasualPT just unassumingly being the wisest, most grounded and most open minded place focused on the lives of portuguese people. It ranges from people looking for genuine advice in Swing bars, people with BPD stuck in life venting it out with people acknowledging them, people lost in their 20s being validated and guided... Its like NaBoaChavaloRetardado and CasualPT share like 99% of all braincells between them, while r/portugal is a news outlet, r/PORTUGALCARALHO's memes are NOT invented and r/portugueses is made of exclusively dysfunctional individuals. 


And I gotta talk about a youtube video. By the way... whoever posted it has balls of carbonized tungsten. Its a video titled: "How to sell to the Negro". This is how you know that they, at least at a superficial glance, have zero fear in crossing "social vibes" related boundaries: The video is staticky and played in a 1:1 porportion, has 50's style commercial instrumental music with metal air instruments and stuff, the people all wear formal clothes and the guy is just... man... so 50's! They address people of dark skin as Negros (because... they... are), its a whole ass video telling you how to, to put it bluntly, manipulate people of a minority into doing something that might not initially align with their best interests and it is a commercial. And my SJW ass really clicked it just so I could get pissed at something! But... while watching it... it.... wasnt condescending, it wasnt cynical, it did not involve prejudice... The word "Negro" was purely used as a factual descriptor for what they look like (I mean its the 50's, cut em some slack) and... it wasnt derogatory or cynical, as I said: they said stuff like: "As they are used to being sold cheap stuff all the time, they became wary. They only buy on brand. And... if they pick something... dont tell them to buy something else or that waryness will kick in and they will leave your shop! So just bear with them... and just focus on the article's price. Also... be mindful of the minefield of raising the negotiation price while striking a deal with a negro. Compliment their appearance, their smile, and their hygienne, as they also overcompensate for being called dirty for generation after generation. And focus on quality... as they are a practical, resourceful bunch and have a knack for what they need and if what they see will serve them well. Just. Focus. On. The. Price. Yatta yatta yatta" like... yeah! it *is* manipulative, like any commercial... but it was just so... tactical, logical, grounded and... surprisingly educational and insightful...

Like... *chuckles* it just sounds so tactical and cool headed... like "How to sell to negro #4328"

It sounded like they really knew their stuff about selling to the negro and that they genuenly wanted you to learn it and suceed lmao

Like...Its almost as if... the racist people... and the sales people were, as it should be, completly separated! *M I N D  B L O W N*

I just took a walk... and a moment happened: I was strolling down the street... and a black man wearing really worn and old looking clothes (he looked like he was in his 35-45's) and was running at me. And then, Im assuming because I always do that with people because it feels cool or whatever the hell I think, Dodged him in a bit of an overdrammatic way. He looked like he was very unsettled, upset and rilled up and yelled at me: "Walk propelly boy! Do you think Im gonna kill you or something?" (One of the prejudiced of black people in Portugal is that they are dangerous) which made me rile up a bit. Then... some distance after we engaged, I wingspan spread my arms in disbelief uttering: "What? You were in my way so I dodged!"... but with a deep seeded feeling that I dodged a slap from an upset girlfriend. Well... After I engaged with him, approach the security guard at the exit of a LIDL shop nearby and he was also black. The guard, who I was close to as a friend, and I performed a casual greeting with a purposefully awkward fistbump and missaimed, flailing slap of the hand and, in a playful way, before... welp it doesnt matter at this instant. We greeted and then the guard told me "That guy has a screw loose. he ran down the street, then back up... then back here again..." So... I took that to heart, for a moment, to assert my own conviction that it was all a coincidence... and that I had no prejudices. But then... I began intuitively evaluating it (I call it "Intuitively" because I wasnt really using words), and... combining my background as a sheltered kid born from a rich, white family in pre-colonial Mozambique, After remembering the jarring tones with which my Grandmother would call me, yelling "URSO! NEGRO!" when I made her GENUENLY HURT and UPSET, and how I framed my whole family as a bunch of racists for almost my whole life, believing it was all in their DNA, I also believed it could also be in MY DNA... I was sheltered, stay in my room all day, have an emotionally volatile streak... so I have the vibes to be a r/portugueses user. I also believe that... I wasnt really that square-in-front-of that guy that it required me to dodge him... maybe Im just dodging the truth? But... how the hell am I suposed to change something so neurologically ingrained in my brain by myself? Why do I have to carry that burden? It has to be true, doesnt it? So... I began, intuitively motivated, (as I had consciously buried it) devising a plan to approach people with his general demenanour in the future: Lonely, upset and revolted and resentful, feeling like no one listens or validates them... And here is what I would do:

1st- DONT Take the initiative. he already looked very unsettled and volatile... and that would make it REALLY seem to him that I am about to scold him because thats what he believes, at least inside
2nd- Important note: there is a VERY HIGH chance he WONT Hit me. because... he clearly de-values violence. He may have subconscious beliefs against people in hoodies, wired earbuds, phones in hand, pale skin and acne with nerdy, red looking lips (may think of them as cowardly and prejuditial), but he knows that hitting ANYONE will make him look "Worse" according to his view, of other people's perceptions. His subconscious is telling him like: "I cant hit him. I will look bad and THEN these people REALLY wont listen to me"
3rd- I have to stay calm. At his worst, he will probably T pose in disbelief with a raised chin, yell at me in a really self righteous and offended tone with his eyes wide open, he will do stuff like, as he feels like he is in a glass dome, look around and be like: "hey! hey! hey you! see this guy? hey! see him! see this guy!" But then, because he is so upset and biased be like: "Ahh no one cares, fuck you!" Then focus back on me and resume yelling, probably with his face closer, probably also spitting (Clear that stuff from your face, of course) and with eyes REALLY open too... but Stay. Calm. He is really rilled up and any kind of emotional charge will make it WORSE. 
4th- Then... as for the beginning of the approach... just *listen* and *try* to understand. Read between the lines. and ... then just wing it, like with any social interaction

But their sales people. Honestly... I wish every company nowdays acted like the 50s video. Its expected for them to be pragmatic
