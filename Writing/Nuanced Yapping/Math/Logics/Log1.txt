Comput8ional logic

Make proofs:

Step 1: CNF: Every formula can B dat.
So convert that hoe!

After dat, Check CNF clauses! (Each multi part disjunction)
If there is prop and n(prop)

for 1 prop in every clause...


VALID!


Ok... Not valid? Fuck... ok.
Is it a fraud bruh? (Contradictory)

Ok... step 1: Is it a horn formula?

If there is at most 1 positive in each clause, then it is!

Anyways...

Place that b*** in2 horn formula to follow the ways of the horns!


(Implic8ion clauzes.)


Anyways...


After that hoe gets f***ing horned,
den we make an empty set.

Make a function that collects every single prop clause. Dose props are vacuously true. So... the function applied to the empty set returns a set of every vacuous prop.

After that, we pack those fuckers up into a set and shove it up the functions ass.
After we rape the function (We will do it several times),
It will return everything for which there is a left side, made up of a subset of the one we impaled the function with (Implic8ions), our set plus the premisses on da right. (Can only B 1 positive? Remebah! Thats the point of the horny(ing)!)
Shit clauses without positives (w/o gainz) imply AW HELL NAW BRO! ABSURD! (skull emoji). If we get a set where there is a conjunction in a left side of horn clause that is the subset of us, the formula is, indeed, a fraud! But... if we keep going and, either run outta premisses to eat up or our set cannot grow anymore for some other reason, the formula is possible! Its a tepid centrist!


Done! Now go find out which formulas are the #GOAT and which are Boomer frauds! (Skull emoji)
