Honestly... Im kind of a cold person... if people start to like me... I mostly just dip, metaphorically... and... my mom had... well... the big sad... and smoked alot... in bed... for high stretches of time... went to sleep at 7 pm... woke up at 2 am... drank coffee... watched tv... once a year until my early teens she woke me up at 4 am so we could take a bus to the capital to get pediatric appointments... and the hospital was also a decaying mess... the whole place scared me, the floor was made of wood and while passing by the corridors of radiology appointments while on my way to the pediatric alleys, all those stickers... I remember them so well...
