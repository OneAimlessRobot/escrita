I found out that the reason I used to stay in college which I labeled as "getting more creative" Was wrong. Yes. the real reason also has to do with enabling creavity. But its to merely "just increase it". It is to ground it and give actual power and substance behind each creative stroke of creativity. I need to strenghten my Si to evolve. During this period of self misunderstanding, I also dropped essential habits that, in heindsight, were not founded or justifiable by my identity so they held me back spiritually, but they were worth... millions.

yet... during this time I have grown exponentially and explored (and... arguably, exploited) my talents for imagery, art and expression to self destructive extents. At the same time, now I know myself like never before... but lack  connection to what trully makes me, and I neglect it. But now I havd one more piece to work with... so my sense of hope is replenished.
