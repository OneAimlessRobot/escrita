Okay, if ADHD is like a very loud party and is a schizophrenia, like an earthquake, where like...
What? But I know what Im talking about, so shut up! Anyways, earthquakes are, like, unpredictable and unforeseen things that, like, no one really knows when they will happen. Also, they are caused by known things, you know? They are caused by something. They are not random. Like, they're like, uh, the, like, the, it's like, in a, in a computer, they appear out of the RAM. Like, the RAM that is currently not being used by any programs, right? Like, programs leave random values there, right? Until the operating system cleans them. But, like, programs use the memory very logically, but we never really know what will appear there at all times. So, that's where schizophrenia becomes unpredictable. Where ADHD is like a very loud party. Where, like, it's chaotic, it's loud, and it's kind of obnoxious for people who, who, all certain nature. But, it doesn't mean that it's random or, or, like, uh, uh, or, like, caused by things out of our control. ADHD, although, like, people cannot control certain things, because parties, like, uh, they, people get dragged into the flow of the party. Like, it's still organized, and it's still orchestrated by someone, you know? Where, like, uh, schizophrenia is not.
