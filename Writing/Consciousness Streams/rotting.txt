rotting:

Damn... now... Im just... kinda empty... very empty... rotting... when project is done... very rotting... a flicker of sound in the bottom... in the core... slowly fading... after battles of confusion, self assuredness and more... missed obligations and justificatioms mixed with pride and fulfilment. But now... I feel less and less... bright... dim.... bright, dim.... bright, dim... bright, dim... bright, dim... the light of my essence almost fully off... The dynamo inside goes from leaving radial after images... to... flickering rather fast... spinning at a discernable pace... to then spinning rather fast... my body... thirsty. My mind... foggy with emo thoughts. Dysphoria. Nothing makes sense. Nothing is clear. Confusion and noise. Dysphoria and cold. Sensation anemia. Anhedonia. Rotting. Laying in bed... barely able to move... 4 in the morning and still kicking. Restless... sun startved. Touch starved. Loser. Monster Energy. But little motivation. Spent essence: Resource still busy. Segmentation fault at line 1: Thinking about tomorrow. Never do that again. Ok? Please dont.
