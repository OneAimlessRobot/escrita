Friends 1:

3 of my medschool friends:

One feels kinda hard 2 reach emotionally
but is really straightforward and
hardworking. Another is a really close
and genuine friend, that stays with me
no matter how annoying | get (I sweat
she is an IRL angel FR) and then another
medschool friend, who, | swear 2 god, carries HOUSE ON HER BACK! She is super selfless, hardworking and funny too!
