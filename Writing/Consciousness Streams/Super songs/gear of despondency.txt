Honestly... Im kind of a cold person... if people start to like me... I mostly just dip, metaphorically... and... my mom had... well... the big sad... and smoked alot... in bed... for high stretches of time... went to sleep at 7 pm... woke up at 2 am... drank coffee... watched tv... once a year until my early teens she woke me up at 4 am so we could take a bus to the capital to get pediatric appointments... and the hospital was also a decaying mess... the whole place scared me, the floor was made of wood and while passing by the corridors of radiology appointments while on my way to the pediatric alleys, all those stickers... I remember them so well...

leaves the classroom... beginning to walk off the school, the air cold with the darkening of night, a faint blue color... and some stars


On my way home... I put on music. The cars passing by remind me of the passivity with which ive been living... just letting things go if they complain... just giving up if I make a mistake... as if I had a mistake budget


I arrive on the bus stop. my music raging like a tornado as I hover my bus pass over the scanner... and pick a seat... away from everybody next to a window.

I begin wondering whats beyond 

sitting on the bus... the sound of its idle diesel engine and rumbling therapeutic on my body... as I drift into passive haze, looking somewhere far but not anywhere... the music sounding more like a raging jet engine nearby than an actual tune with nuance and depth

*The bus stops. I glance over at the entrance to try and evaluate the sorts of people that get in.*

*My legs heavy as I let out a yawn... the trees being softly washed by the wind... reminding me of all the wishes and whims I bury deep in my mind... not touching them... always focused on the present... no digestion, no relaxation. Just pure... despondency*
