Popular girl: "Omg! what are you? eighty?"


Life only feels validating to me... when I forget about some vague dready need of "surviving".
And I am tired and I want. Every. Single. Cubic. Nanometer. Embraced by the constitution of this entire existence to just turn off like a lightbulb to never ever turn on again. I feel tepid
