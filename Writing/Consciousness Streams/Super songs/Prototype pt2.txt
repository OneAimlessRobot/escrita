Vibe: "Alone my bedroom... or better said... my... pod... my computer still on... I had just booted it up to play some vidya... but today... late in the evening... just had dinner and I am sat down in my bed... looking at my own two hands... just inspecting every facet of them: Their shape... the bones... the way they feel when I squeeze them... Looking at my legs, The room I am in... trying to imagine what a common bedroom would look like: Do they... also have curtains to protect you from the sun? Do they have shelves for books and things? Do they have wardrobes like mine too? Do they have a computer? or... is that just a lab girl thing? A lab girl in her pijamas... that need so much washing... they are getting bleached. White stains of my sweat in my armpits from sleeping at night. I enjoy thick heavy blankets as it is easy to fall sleep... so I sweat alot at this time of the year... in the summer... And my body. As tonight I have privacy... I decide to take out my sweater... my thermal shirt... and... cup a breast. It feels... soft. Trail circles around my own, defines abdominal muscles. They feel... tough... like... like hard rubber. Like a cow steak. I put my shirt back on.  Then... ruffle my own hair... "What is it made of? is it... Queratin? is it... some kind of plastic?" Then... touch my sides... *Theres... muscle. Some ribcage... and... skin. Soft, white skin... *Then begin recalling a specially tough mission... where I had to escape dying from asphyxiation as I was stuck in a sinking submarine and had to punch a hole through the thick glass to scrape my way out. I still feel the glass stuck in my abdomen to this day... And the urgency in my legs... and the sheer repression... and then... after I made it to the chopper, and then back home, my dad's hug and then... I recall the countless hours I spent trying to get better at burnout. the multiple tumbles on my rollerblades. Burnout is so much fun... taking opponents down... sending them crashing into tanker trucks... Laughing with my dad at dinner... about his horrendous sense of humor... only to get picked for a mission where I had to find the origins of an anomaly that was causing havoc in the city... picking people one by one. I met this one lady... and had to comfort her. I hurt her with bluntness instead. * then... I get up. I open my wardrobe... looking at myself in the body sized wardrobe... noticing some features... like my breasts, arms, collarbone... some width of my thighs... through the large, loose, flannel, full body pijammas... patterned with flowers... blue colored like my eyes... and... my messy hair...* then... close the wardrobe... and think about the tools I am assigned to do my homework: "Sometimes... dad gives me a pencil... and tells me to listen. And then... he gives me a rifle... and tells me "Take them out". I run faster than machines, and jump higher than almost any animal. So... I am stronger than machines, more agile than animals, but still play videogames and laugh... the question is... when does it all coalesce? When am I "Ready"? Where does this patchwork of facets that makes me up converge? What am I to dad? am I his daughter? He clearly likes me alot. And... I can accept being born out of curiosity instead of romantic affection. I can feel both emotions... I know none of this is wrong but... it all just feels... so... incredibly bizarre... the people at the skatepark look at me like I am an alien... yet I was told my entire life, by both dad and my makeshift mother figure... that everyone is normal... and everyone is weird... but... their looks... tell me... they tell me that, although I can keep up, although I also tumble... that Im just... incomplete. It all fell in place so smoothly but it all feels... so rushed. So clinical. So... eerily disjointed and... convoluted. I can be playing videogames and then be drafted to Namibia. I am so strong... but... Dad hugs me so tightly when I come back... getting me all Confused at all his worry when I come back from missions. My rollerblades next to the bycicle... next to the shelf... with nothing in it, as I never really enjoyed reading. Daddy said that books would not make me any smarter than real life experiences... and that I did not need to feel bad about being averse to staying still... he said my ADHD is just a quirk of mine... a faced to be respected. But... the videos on youtube... they all talk about war like its some nightmare... and then... they are so toxic to... seemingly mundane people... I... I dont understand any of it... So Now... I will go back to bed... and sit for a while longer... hoping, today or eventually, to find a reason for my existence... beyond what I am told.

Drafted to Namibia, relaxing to virtual cars being smashed into pieces... 

Learning my 4th language and then going rollerblading with Kyle and John at the skatepark in a Tuesday afternoon...

Cupping my soft breast in a private night moment... to then chasing after an important payload carried by a truck allegedly belonging to a saboteur...

My life is a patchwork of bizzare, interconnected experiences... which made me believe the only thing that exists is the present.

Healthy? A slave of the unpredictible forces that surround me? Or merely... a constantly evolving... prototype of a soul?
