*Nereid Author's notes*


One of the lines Im gonna use in the bout if I remember is: "*Adriano and sheilla stare at eachother tired mid fight. Sheilla has been struggling with keeping Adriano in place, and sheilla's sheer grit and power are proving to be overwheming. Adriano stats moving erratically again, charging up another dempsey roll.* *Sheilla scowls* YOU ARE LIKE SAND! EVEN WHEN THROWN AT ME I CAN JUST DUST IT OFF! MOVE ALL YOU WANT! GO AHEAD! USE STAMINA FOR ME!


But then Adriano *smirks daringly with a hint of genuine anger* says: "WELL WELL! GIRL HAS FANGS ON HER TONGUE TOO! I MAY BE SAND BUT YOURE STARTING TO GET WAY TOO INTO IT! YOUR BODY IS WET SO WATCH OUT! IT MAY GET STICKY!
