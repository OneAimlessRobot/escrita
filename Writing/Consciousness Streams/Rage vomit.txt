No... I like them in general... I guess... but... I like playing them... not having to be good at them to unlock stuff...
I like making mods for games
NO! NO! Absolutely not! *playing* makes me frustrated! While creating... no matter how long stuff takes to get to work, I never lose hope and never... try to break my table from how angry I get. And I am not exaggerating. I knee the table from the underside at full power, I punch it, I scream... its honestly so embarassing... at least racing games are fun... but... I just like them when they are easy... and that just makes me feel so guilty and innadequate... I like games when I can use them as action figures... like... tell me... why would anyone use something meant for escape as a reason to stress themselves? Why do they complain on the internet because of "lack of challenge"? Why do people around me tell me they "like challenge"? I... I dont like challenge...! I... the frustration makes me so angry that at its peak I lose all hope... and I dont wanna get better at games. I dont. I dont. I dont. I refuse. I am not good at games nor meant to be. I wanna make/play with mods and make cool stuff happen... I dont like games. And dont even get me started on the football games... I... I dont understand them. You have so many buttons and skills to press... racing games are fun... but they are simple. it seems like... the more the "playing" aspect is reduced, the more I like the game. The simpler the "playing" part is, or the more I feel like I can bring the game to look like what I want it to look like, the better I feel. I dont want to be good at games because I cant become good at games. The buttons... and all the moments where I just end up mashing everything just to rid myself of the hellish frustration... I dont understand Mr Jung! Why do people like videogames so much? Why? I feel like I only play them out of nostalgia! Why?! Tell me! there must be something wrong with those people! I dont understand! If not wrong with them, then wrong with me! Tell me! Tell me!
Okay one thing I already knew before reaching out is: No. More. Football. Games. If I have to grind Ill use cheats. I dont care.

When I play games and Immediatly start getting pissed off... it feels like I am vomiting my soul...
