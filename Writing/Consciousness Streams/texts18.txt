Hey, I went on a walk after my last message and I discovered some things about myself. For example, I encountered an example of reprojecting. I will continue after I stop this.

It's because I have ADHD and I am a creative person. I like doing creative things like programming and writing, as you can see, and I love just being in the zone and feeling like I am, quote-unquote, my words cooking for a family, just performing really well, solving problems, or when I'm in the middle of a confusion that I feel will lead me to good things. And I don't want, like, to interrupt people because it feels like it's a bit like when I am interrupted. I feel like I'm inconveniencing people a lot and, like, it's me projecting my fears, basically, my tendencies to people.
