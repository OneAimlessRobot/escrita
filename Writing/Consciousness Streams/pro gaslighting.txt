I wish mind games were a sport. I want to go blow for blow in a mind game contest with someone. I wanna see how cruel I can really be....I want there to be Elo rankings too. And an 'asshole dor'

Not healthy? Neither is fighting. People do it all the time. Cte is not healthy for the brain. Mind games are not healthy for the identity. I dont give a percent of a damn

Both people would consent

Punching someone in the face also is not productive


Damn it! You are so close minded! Why cant there be violent mind sports?


I have some rules for mind games then: They cant go near eachother before the fight, they have to read the person on the spot and they cant use slurs

Attack example for when you notice someone starting to take just a bit too much than they serve: "Use your 3 neurons. Rub em. Make some smoke"
