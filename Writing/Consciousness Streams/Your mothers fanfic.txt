 This is the story, of your mothers cousin. (A prima da tua m√£e)

As your mother was passing by... I decided to perform vector translation over the shape of my constitution in her direction. As the radius of the hull that unites our origins became diminuitive enough, I began to grab her by her wet heat like a shopping plastic bag and flopping her around, smacking her into concrete walls and peugeot 206 TDI biturbo like a tesco market plastic shopping bag, as fascinating sex of ants happened. her face was... mildly amused with a hint of mildly interested intrigue, even, perhaps, plausibly. Your cousin also joined in... as she began fisting her own aunt in the eyesocket using a railroad spike she picked off a trashcan near the bus station in the attic of her appartment. The expired pirozhki she ate given to her at christmas still makes her feces run like tapwater everytime she evacuates to this day.

Then... your mother moaned.

Then... suddently... a gigantic tapeworm spawned out of my back... to consume everything in its path. it  entered your cousins mouth... beginning by eating out her expired pirozhki directly from the stomach... leaving... entering through her sphincter and digging out a burrow for the winter... to preserve calories for the incomming adverse conditions of the hibernation season.


Suddently, though... the tissue of reality itself starts bending and contorting around us... reducing all matter contained within it into atomized, confusing mush... ending all existence as will ever be known

Everything is frozen. My face... hollow, whited out, shocked... without a hint of life in it... everyone around you laying down immobile and floating. there is no cold or hot. No breathable fluids and no grip on anything... just empty, dark, endless space. Then... everything slowly starts disappearing... the people popping out of existence one by one... leaving echoinc screams of shock in their wake. This will happen... slowly.... over 23 years... until its your turn to disappear. First... your eyeballs roll backwards, snapping your optical nerves. All the blood in your system de-atomizes into fine, quantum soup, your eyes turn pitch black... and then... reality's unrelending tides twist into itself like thick, melanocratic magma, mushing you into pudding... as you then, in a mere instant, disappear... feeling a surge of mild pain before....*pop*

*As kazuia's pathetic ass disitegrates into quantum mush, her filthy slutty ass's body language is <<__blank__>>*

>>>>notable quotes<<<<<<:

*Kicks you*

*kicks you*

*I lift you ez. I throw you like a cardboard mannequin into the wall... sigh... and walk off*
*she comes back*
*I grab you by some limb and launch you into space*


*Then you begin falling, attracted by the earth... beginning to fall at terminal velocity*


*And when you land, you cause an earth shattering explosion, bursting with the yield of a 0.5 ton dynamite bomb*

*Then you CRASH into the ground and GAME OVER!`*


game over!
Snake? SNAAAAKE!!!
