Me in "Desperate escapist"/"Happy go lucky"/"Silly" mode:

- "Rawmaxxes" (Drugs self by skipping sleep so my thoughts "get more stimulating"/"Make more sense"/"be more real" and to "get rawer" (Mask has little effect so ego restricts the Id less. I get more expressive and proactive. Also the air restriction plate for my creativity goes out the window. But I also more agitated, overly sensitive and "validation sucking" than usual, which ramps up with the fact things obviously upset me way more than usual. My thoughts get darker. My questions get generally more stupid, but may also surpass my usual astuteness by a considerable factor)

- Masturb8s

- Gets more hype.

- Feels unending pleasure.

- Gets exausted at the first 2 hours of the "new day"

- Very, very, very avoidant, needy and vulnerable.


- Sharply more curious. (Arguably...even excessively)

- Teasing gets very excessive. Way more awkward or even borderline offensive.
