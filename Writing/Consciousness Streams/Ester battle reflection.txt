No Im serious... these people are not okay okay? I dont care how judgy I sound. For me, they are all school shooters before further evidence
(Ok lets be real Im just thankful. The only thing I did was contact steam support... Im still vulnerable to this lmao... happens to anyone)


Bro I fucking love writing I dont care. I dont care if I ignore college... this is like 10x more impressive than anything I could ever achieve in college and I will die on this hill

And honestly... its not just me saying "college is bad". Because... healthygamer can suck my milimeter sized donkchonk but... as an ENTP, conventional school is like a cube on a circle for me... I always prefer programming projects where I get feedback from teachers... and they also feel bad. They genuenly care about me being exploratory... but they just feel so powerless because... they just cant... do anything about it. They get paid go grade and thats how school works...


Btw (The only character ive played was Ester if you did not notice) I did play these characters Ive made well, rigth?

Like... and I like the battle... because it showed a deep truth: You cant live life being a white force all the time... sometimes you cant even be a white force ever... sometimes you need to be a little ratty... and defeat the opposition with ambushes no matter how hard you try. For example: What ester had with Toga can barely be considered a battle. it was a mugging. A complete assault. It wasnt fair.. It was engineous but... it was stealthy... and... ratty! But thats just how life goes most of the time you know? *Sigh...* I wish I could talk to healthy gamer... but I dont wanna mess with that discord phone number stuff... it all sounds like a mess... Spent a whole day on it... did not wanna bother anymore
