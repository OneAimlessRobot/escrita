The prospect of ever getting an Yandere girlfriend (as I am into them) fascinates me, but also terrifies me due to all the memes I read and the stuff I know about psychology. So I imagined this silly scenario: "
*she begins saying "sorry" compulsively because I steered her into doing it*

HA! I GOT YOU TO SAY IT! ok. That triggered a dialogue sequence with me: From now on, everytime you either, ask for forgiveness compulsively or anything like that, You'll have to do it in B R I H I S H language. For example: Instead of repeatedly saying "Im sorry!" (And I know you know the kinds of "sorries" I am refering to, as you are self aware), You will have to, for every "Im sorry", say this instead: "I sincerely apologise for having catalized such an inconvenient predicament". And you will have to say it out loud, in full extension AND in an expressive, articulate and polite voice. Got it?

*She does the same but with the word "right"*

Ok... that is also valid for the word "right". You will have to say this instead: "I think you should agree with me, my good sir!"

*Its suposed to be therapeutic because 
1- its funny
2- Those "sorries" are rarely even relevant
3- everytime she has to think about it, she will remember what I told her, my cheeky tone and all, and it may even prevent her, from intrinsic motivation, from devolving into compulsive self doubt*
