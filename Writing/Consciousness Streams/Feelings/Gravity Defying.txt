hits hard after a long period of struggle. Like... nostalgia dwelling after a period through immediate anxiety hell. Like being a soccer manager lifted by his players after a triumph over a derby match. Its like what I feel immediatly after a big discovery preceeded by asphixyating confusion. a raw feeling of relief. Like... you know... when you finally settle after hard work, wether simply existing. A hard programming idea come to life. A masterpiece of a drug finally gotten right. A huff of weed. A beautiful feeling finally materialized after immense perfectionism. A sip of the bottle during a period in life when its all simply too much. About a weight lifted off you that literally makes you float in the air. Defy gravity. Gravity defying.
