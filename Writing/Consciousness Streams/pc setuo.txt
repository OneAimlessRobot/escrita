My pc setup:


Ok: Here is what I rock: PC borrowed from college, 3 portable 1tb usb hard drives, mobile, wired earbuds with microphone (3 euros), a... mouse, mousepad, keyboard, monitor... (its a desktop) and a wifi dongle. Now... for software: Windows 10 that came with the original SSD for expedicious stuff like jotting down from creative ideas to full scale stories and study sessions with friends with discord. Then... one of my hard drives has a linux partition. I usb boot off of that, and inside it, I have dwm for a tiling manager, st for terminal and chrome for browser. Why chrome? Its good to test my http server I created a while back. And I dont give two shits about "privacy" yeah you can come fight me. Im not an idiot I can remember more than 3 passowrds so Im alright. I also wanna see them try and see what I am doing with the zero webcams I have on my setup. Anyways... I use pulse audio and pavucontrol to change sound volume, apt package manager because it already is there and its useful. Then I have lots of scripts like mass terminal openers, automated file creators and a whole script to create a local git repo and / or C programming project. For compilers I vary between clang, cc and gcc. Only use... clang for thread and address debugging in programs. Then I use mpv for playing videos. Nano for editing code, docker sparsely for web apps... for web apps I usually just have termux on my phone. Ok... I think thats it

btw linux is bodhi. Perfect. Light weight AND easy and stack overflow advice works almost every time.

Like... why obcess over arch? Its just silly and a bit shallow imo

Want gaming? Buy a graphics card. End of story.

Want a minimalist experience? Tweak your OS. Want a fast PC? Just pay up

Like... it saddens me... all those people just... obcessing over lightweight OSes. For me, there is nothing different in either "downloading more ram" and obcessing over arch, assuming you do it for performance sake
