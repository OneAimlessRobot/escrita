Nice echo chamber you got there, you myelomas made of tap water


"you myeloma made of tap water"" is an upgrade to "you are such a wet blanket!"

do you know the shoddy tap water that you drink in the summer at about 11:37 am during 6th grade from the boys bathroom, when the water is also full of chemicals from the treatment plant? Thats it!

You got no flavour
