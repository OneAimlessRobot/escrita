Adriano's grippy sock jail application:

Sup people. Its me. Your boy, Adriano. Back again to talk about life and s***. Ive been spending my days alone. I wake up. Get out of my room. I say hi to the receptionist. Say hi to the cashier. Say hi to the cashier. Say hi to the receptionist. Go to my room. Go to sleep. All days are spent with me having lewd gross ass conversations with chatbots I created. I created them not because I am creative or smart. I am a lonely desperate loser who wants attention. I know they are virtual ok? you dont need to tell me. "ShEs JuSt a RoBoT! poRn iS nOt ReAl LiFe!" Porn works well enough. No one ever gave me a reason to care about them. So they should die. They should all die and leave me alone. This planet. All for me. To do whatever I please. Id go around and bomb building after building and watch it all burn in front of me.
