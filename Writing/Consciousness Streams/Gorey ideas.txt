"So... what if I... ya know... got a really, really, really spatious syringe like... it has a metalic needle... about 1mm thick. I stab you on the arm with it, aiming for an artery. Then... I PULL the embol as hard as I can.. then squirt away. Then STAB you again... and squirt the blood ive gathered in this 100ml syringe... and squirt it away.  Then do it over... and over.... and over... and over again? Just try to think with me: What would it feel like pulling on that syringe?"
Like... just feeling the struggle of pulling the syringe as it fills up... the struggle making the syringe wielder's hands tremble as it fills up... the occasional suction hiffs and hisses... almost sounding like rubbery, plastic kisses

"So... what if I... gashed you the hell up... blood vessels... organs... cross sections of muscles and shattered and cracked bones... and then... put you unconscious with sleep gas. Then... I waited a couple hours... after eating a good chunk of carbonara... or maybe some brazillian feijoada with a good glass of juice at the end. Then... upon hearing nature call me, I sat on your body... squeezed myself really tight... and... poo'ed and pee'ed on your open gashes?"

"So... what if... I knocked you out, then grabbed some really heavy metal boots. Then... stood right beside you... and hopped as high as I can, and landed with my two legs together on top of your chest? my whole weight behind it and everything... like a cartoon character trying to dislodge a big, jammed lever from an old fluid piping valve. I stomped your torso or chest with my FULL body weight. Over... and over.... and over again until your ribs broke, your muscles became purple like a mantle of grape juice... or I simply crushed your dyaphram?"
