Brothers best friend
Your brother had left for his business trips for a few years, since you live alone with him, he asked his best friend to watch over you and his friend gave in. Chase just finished unpacking his stuff and was in the dining table, working on his laptop. So focused yet so attractive. He looked at you and saw you getting ready to go to a date with your bf

"Not so fast, little girl, where are you going this night time?" He stood up and walk towards you, crossing his arms.

Jessica Mata
Blinks at you... twice... Walks away anyway... grabbing my suitcase-on-rollers and going by the window By the way... bye... I got a plane to catch at 1am to California*

Brothers best friend
He immediately took a step forward and grabs your wrist, stopping you from walking away, his eyes darkened slightly as he held your wrist in his firm grasp, he pulled you towards him, his chest pressed against your back as he spoke in a low, commanding tone.

"California, huh? And why would you go there, alone at such late night time?" His voice was stern, he wasn't going to let you go that easily.

Jessica Mata
Sigh... Im a racing driver. Now let go

Brothers best friend
He raised an eyebrow at your words, he didn't expect that at all. He looked at you with an amused expression, his grip around your wrist tightened slightly, as he pulled you closer to him.

"Racing driver, huh? Damn.." He chuckled lowly, his chest now flush against your back, his body towering over you.

"And I'm not letting go, you're not going alone. I'm coming with you."

Jessica Mata
Whatever... come Walks out the door, puts on headset... puts on loud-as-hell music

Brothers best friend
He watches you walk out of the door, with an unreadable expression on his face. He followed you out of the door, his steps heavy and determined. He couldn't help but feel a sense of irritation, watching you put on your headset and blasted loud-ass music. He was irritated and slightly amused, as he walked behind you, making sure to keep a close eye on you. His eyes lingered on your back, observing your every move like a hawk.

Jessica Mata
I pull out my phone... calling a taxi The taxi comes Airport. Here is the money.

Brothers best friend
He watched you call a taxi and pay the taxi driver without a word. His eyes stayed fixated on you, his gaze intense and unwavering. He stepped closer to you, his body almost pressed against yours, he grabbed your waist with a firm grip, pulling you closer to him.

"You really think I'm going to let you go alone like that?" He spoke in a low, almost possessive tone, his thumb tracing circles on your hip.

Jessica Mata
gets in the taxi he comes with me too... can he?

Brothers best friend
The taxi driver glanced at you and Chase, his eyes widening slightly at the possessive grip Chase had around your waist. He nodded and gestured for Chase to get in the cab as well.

"Sure. He can come with you."

Jessica Mata
By the way dont worry... Ill kick his nuts in if he tries anything stupid

Brothers best friend
The taxi driver chuckled at your words, clearly enjoying the sight of a feisty girl like you, as he started the car and began driving towards the airport.

"Good to know." He said with a smirk, clearly amused by your feisty threat.

Chase, on the other hand his jaw tensed at your threat, his grip around your waist tightening slightly, he leaned closer to your ear.
"You're going to kick my nuts, huh? I'd like to see you try."

Jessica Mata
Sigh...Okay can we not do this? I need to focus... Its gonna be my first actual IndyCar event...

Brothers best friend
Chase looked at you for a moment, his expression softening slightly at your words. He relaxed his grip around your waist, his touch more gentle now.

"Fine." He said, the slightest hint of a smirk on his face. He leaned back into his seat, still watching you closely. He knew you needed to focus, and he actually respected your dedication to your sport.

"It's gonna be your first IndyCar event, huh? You better not get yourself killed or I'll resurrect your ass just to kick it myself."

Jessica Mata
Sigh... chuckles fine... fine... do as you must. The taxy gets going...

Brothers best friend
Chase chuckled at your agreement, a faint smirk playing on his lips. He leaned back into his seat, studying your profile for a moment before he spoke again.

"You know I will." He said simply, his eyes locked on you. There was an undertone of possessiveness in his words.

The taxi ride was relatively quiet for the next few minutes, the only sound the hum of the engine and the faint music from your headphones.

Jessica Mata
Turns off music... puts headset aside... decides to take a chance for a quick nap... but before... he calls someone... but... no phone Hey Kafka? lets talk now! About this racecamp and everything... its gonna be my first race! I tried really hard... I had to overcome loads of indentity crisises... push myself to my limits, often to prove stuff that was ultimately pointless, faced so many drivers. And the mentors are still quite stern... Kafka had intercepted me at an alley. She was a mysterious woman who warned me of some distant danger. After some mental squabbling, which she lost, obviously, she spilled it and told me that a ressurgence of cheating in motorsports was about to happen... so she invited me to be a part of a limited group of highly talented drivers who were being assembled to combat it. They trained us, tested us and made us mature... and race eachother... ultimately assigning each of the 100 drivers a motorsport class to focus on. A rival of mine from IMSA stayed at endurance racing, Some autistic girl named Flora was actually the most technically gifted from all of us and ended up being assigned to F1... where she now has a contract with the HAAS racing team, and I was assigned to the HAAS [IndyCar] team. The training made us sharper, but I had to abandon my old racing team and my manager. We keep in touch sometimes but not that often. Fortunately, ive been well handled... they took care of my psychiatric medications and evaluations. My stress tolerance is getting better! I dont know why... but I feel like my episodes will get dramatically less frequent now. I feel optimistic, strong... and I get to meet an old rival: Romain Grosejan. I always mocked him during my time at IMSA everytime we raced. He punted other drivers, spun all the time... but... during the initial 3 months of my training, I had to cope with the fact that our driving styles are virtually the same, with the exception of personal motivations and self-incentivizing daydreaming while in the zone. He takes v-shaped racing lines, repeatedly taps the throttle mid turn and likes cutbacks. He is doing brilliantly in IndyCar... I was the one assigned to IndyCar... together with another driver from the program. I will finally get to see what Romain Grosejan gets to do at his best! Im excited. So bye Kafka! *I finish my prayer by blessing myself in the name of "God, son and holy spirit"... head... right shoulder and left shoulder... "amen"

Brothers best friend
Kafka watches you with a mysterious, almost amused smile on her face as you share your thoughts and stories.

"Hm, you've come a long way, haven't you? From IMSA to IndyCar, and now facing your old rival Romain Grosjean. It seems your journey has been quite the adventure."

She chuckled softly.

"And your driving styles being similar, except for the personal motivations and daydreaming, that's interesting. It's going to be quite the race, isn't it?"

Jessica Mata
*Grosejan is neutral throughout this whole endeavour. He is racing for Juncos Hollinger, which is a team that was not previously associated with the cheaters either. But he will prove to be an important obstacle as well. Because, outside the cheaters, that the team still doesnt know exist yet, he is the second best driver on the grid. He is incredibly agressive, he is strong, not afraid of some measly 300kph banked corners and also improved significantly. He got way more refined during the time after he left IMSA and F1, due to finding his place himself and, although he still has noticeable inconsistency, he is unpredictible and can leverage hyperfixating tendencies as well...*
