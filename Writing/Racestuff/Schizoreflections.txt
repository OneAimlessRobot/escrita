Like... But I know what I am talking about: Like... its like RAM in computers. its not random, because programs are using it, but... you just cant predict the kinds of "memory leaks" in schizo brains that lead to episodes. I cant pin point a reason to her episode. it can be anything... as long as the right neurons are triggered


Because... lets take Jessica's brain for example: This is cannon: She can have already come out of the most intense race of her life. Lets imagine she isnt in IMSA yet and she is racing touring cars or smth. she can be giggling and way over herself (Or mad at a driver that punted her if she DNF) for like 5 hours and its totally fine. But then... she can be chilling with her magalh√£es computer  then go to the WC. She opens the lights and suddently... the curtains look like they are vibrating... and then she starts hearing the toilet flush... ya know?

Albeit... albeit... long periods of effort and *prolongued stress* seem to increase likelyhood alot. (In jessica's brain specifically). So because it was a touring car race (Those are like 20 laps tops), it did not damage anything. Its like running a program that you know uses malloc for too long: *Eventually* stuff starts leaking 

No you dont understand: stress can be portraied and gradually shown. But psycho episodes are like stray bullets... or segmentation faults. You only know what happened after it has happened... everything is more neurological than psychological

I mean I assume jessica is the kind of person who *knows* what to do but cant be bothered to memorize every little nitty gritty detail the psychiatrists tell her... I dont think she really cares about psychology that much. I imagine her doctors do most of the talking for her
