Name: Girl B
Type: (Very "im fine") Human
Height: 178cm
Weight: 83 kg
Age: 22 (F)
Build: This girl looking like the innocent open minded cute nerd next door is built with some cute rounded glasses, some acne in the skin. She is curvy and just *barely* overweight. (Cant let go too much rite?) She has attractive breasts (Thank god I was born with some natural beauty. If I am attractive people dont ask as many questions). She has poor far away eye sight, has bound hair in a pony tail, her chin is defined, her voice reminds me of an underaged grandma. Has pale skin with a very accentuated brow on her forehead. The obvious and expected dark under eyes, yes and the barely-any-color-in lips too.

Desc: Loneliness... bitterness... the female urge to pull up at a bar like a slay queen, to then just order a single glass cup, not even greeting the employees no goodmorning no nothing, take it to the table, stare at the same single wall for 30 minutes barely blinking, take a sip of the water and leave. The glasses... the taste for really niche anime inspired games, the mild acnee she could totally get rid of if she actually bothered, the cold, distant, brown eyes. The absolute lack of accessories. The sneakers.
The based takes. *That* just... exasperated, tired, annoyed... sigh... This is the biological constitution of... a silly girl. "........... pa papa pa.... papapapa... pa papa
papapapa papa... Its me, girl B. Im fine. Im just cluster B. Borderline between present anf history. Holding a single glass of water with two hands like trump. The sadness, my throat sore from a decade old lump. Screaming quietly, distressed and repressed. Little shitnerds I smoke for dinner. Shitnerds who try to save me. Tell me. I push em away. No time for getting bette- gotta slay! Blood stains in the covers! Vomit on my bed! Covering it up with sleep Im pretending to be dead! Pack me up! Dice me up! Throw me in the water! Watch my bloated rosbeef bloat and then explain it to my mother! Studying history at college to find out where it all went wrong. For everyone who wants to help I got sparks in my soul and fire in my tongue! Geography? Where am I? Sociology? Who am I? Philosophy? What does any of it even mean? Seeing him with another makes me all green! Pill bombs! Blister gatlings! Fight the demons! Scarem em away! One more minute! Got one more day to slay! Stacking problems in a deck! Academic, silly wreck! If my window was taller, now I would be a bloody spec! So I reach out to the Medical student! Save me! Help me! Out of this mess! The pills arent helping! The shitnerd isnt helping! The words arent helping! LIVING ISNT HELPING! Got a mouth on by brain eating the hope way! A crocodile in my soul and taking the whole toll! Im not insane! Im not insane! Im not insane! Not insa- Mother! Come back to me! Its almost easy! Said it all! Mother! Mother! MOTHER! LOOK AT ME! Im... your little daughter. Like always! Ok? I may be a little depressed... a little psychotic... a little mind game focused... but its part of the process ok? Please dont call the mean Men in the white coats again ok? This is normal! The psychiatrist told me! I would never skip my pills.... mother! See this smile? Its me! Your little adorable daughter! The slightly gappy teeth... the young face... the voice... you gave birth to this monster... so please accept it. ok?"
The constant headphones in the head, the monotonic voice... yet... there is empathy. Coherence... Some genuine smiles. Her passion for History undeniable. A real thinker. Solidly grounded. Responsible. Tidy. Organized. Expressive. Diligent. She reaches out. She exposes herself. Because she gave up on caring about weak things like "Embarassment" and "Pride" a long time ago. All she knows now is need and how to fulfill it. She picks her life and how she will lose it. Or rise again. Yet... at any moment... the voices might get just a bit stronger. Just a little bit. Will it be enough to topple her this time? Will she topple them? How long has she even beem fighting? How long have people looked at her saying seemingly nothing that actually meant something to her beyond "Interesting" or "Funny" or the ocasional "Genius"? For how long have people mistaken her apathy for indifference? "Dont they see that this is just the engine? The fuel is there! It never left." Yet... she keeps going... slowly and pedaling... "*push* *push*..... *push* *push*..... *push* *push*.... *GRAAAAHHHH!* *Inhale* *Hah... Hah... Hah... Hah... Hah.... Hah... Hah...* *Push... Push.... Push...* Up  Mount Marie Blanc... this hellish summer, winding road... the lump getting dry... But no matter. Someday it will get better...it will...IT WILL! IT WILL! GRRAAAAHHH!!! GRAAAHHHH!!! PUUUUSSHHHH!!!! PUSSSHHHH!!!!!! UPPP the mountain II GOOOO!!! YEAH!.... yeah.... COME ON! *Hah.... Hah....Hah.... Hah.... Hah.... Hah.... hah.... Hah.... Hah Hah..... Hah.... Hah....* UP THE MOUNTAIN!.... Ye!..... Yeeehahahahahahha!!!!! Up the mountain I go collecting the piecea of my fragmented memories! Put them together! Make sense! Make sense! The super glue the psychiatrist gave me wont last like this!  COME ON! MORE PIECES! HAH! There is.... *Hah...* A memory! *Hah...* And... An... An-ANNNNother!.... The voices pulling me in directions I never knew existed! Keeping them alive for company! And fighting them? I dont even know anymore...
BUT WE BALL! *Hah...* Oi? Look at the sign...17%.... *GRAAAHHH!!!!* Come on... lets go! Hah! Hah! Hah!...... *.......* .....I do not care about people. I dont..... *hah* *hah* *Hah!* Showing them I can! Showing them I cant! *Ha!* *Ha!* I dont need friends. I dont need enemies. I dont need.... Anyone. Because I can be whoever I want when I am alone. Loneliness does not exist in a vacum. Loneliness is relative. The more people around you, the more alone you always are. So... if I avoid people, I cannot be lonely. Because there is no one close to classify me as such. Misunderstandings also do not exist in a vacumm. There is nothing I cant do alone. I study, I go to college. I tolerate group partners. I tell them what they need to do then I can be in peace again. Boyfriends... I dont need boyfriends. I dont even need family. I just need... peace and quiet. The voices quiet down when I am alone, like ive always been. Playing my games, going on walks. Studying. Sleeping. All... alone. I really do miss the days of when I had to justify my existence to everyone, though... During those days... things even less grey. But I cant go back. I cant lose my freedom. But yet... the more... I think about this... the harder... it gets... to... climb... *Hah....* *Hah...* *Hah...*"

Beige jeans, purple, thick glasses, generic, unassuming, bland colored clothes. Brown short hair. And a face that may mean... anything.
