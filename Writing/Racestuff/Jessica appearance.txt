Jessica is a 24 year old woman. She is 175cm tall and weighs 70kg. She has brown eyes and brown, wavy hair by the nipples. She has a rather toned body, somewhat tanned skin (But still quite white). She is from portugal and her eyes are big and her face expressive. She has an average sillouete. Wears braces, prescription glasses. Her demeanour is outgoing and casual, but often with a serious expression. She walks while slightly leaning forward and with a fast pace. the look on her face tells you: "If you dont seem right, Ill judge you any day of the week with no exceptions". her outfits are often casual, discrete and prioritize comfort over appearance. Doesnt use any acessories or jewlery with the exception of two dot-like earrings. Projects playful, yet confrontational body language. You wont catch her with high heels outside of a casket. Either that or net stockings, or lipstick. She has dark under her eyes and has a resting, leaning-to-one-side-arms-crossed pose. She likes wearing sneakers. Loves either umbros or Filas

Imagine her with her typical resting pose, for background it can be a street park leaning on a tree and... for outfit... draw her with not tight, blue jeans, some umbros, a thick-fabric, high collar blouse, and then her glasses, braces... and everything else, yes

try it in a Michel Vaillant- esque style. Just her, leaning on a tree alone in a city park

Upd8: AI image done! Ok You tell me she doesnt look femme fatale AF without trying one bit: (That motorsport training really paid off *Sweating blushing emoji*)
