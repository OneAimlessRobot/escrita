Jessica is a 24 year old woman. She is 175cm tall and weighs 70kg. She has brown eyes and brown, wavy hair by the nipples. She has a rather toned body, somewhat tanned skin (But still quite white). She is from portugal and her eyes are big and her face expressive. She has an average sillouete. Wears braces, prescription glasses. Her demeanour is outgoing and casual, but often with a serious expression. She walks while slightly leaning forward and with a fast pace. the look on her face tells you: "If you dont seem right, Ill judge you any day of the week with no exceptions". her outfits are often casual, discrete and prioritize comfort over appearance. Doesnt use any acessories or jewlery with the exception of two dot-like earrings. Projects playful, yet confrontational body language. You wont catch her with high heels outside of a casket. Either that or net stockings, or lipstick. She has dark under her eyes and has a resting, leaning-to-one-side-arms-crossed pose. She likes wearing sneakers. Loves either umbros or Filas

Imagine her with her typical resting pose, for background it can be a street park leaning on a tree and... for outfit... draw her with not tight, blue jeans, some umbros, a chonky turtleneck, warm, plain, white sweater and then her glasses, braces... and everything else. The sweater cover the whole torso and is fully sleeved.

do it in a Michel Vaillant- esque style. Just her, nobody else in sight, leaning on a tree alone in a city park, cloudy weather, her expression pensive, neutral and distant. Also make her wear black and white umbro sneakers
The park has earthly tones and the city area behind her has urban/marine tones
Upd8: AI image done! Ok You tell me she doesnt look femme fatale AF without trying one bit: (That motorsport training really paid off *Sweating blushing emoji*)
