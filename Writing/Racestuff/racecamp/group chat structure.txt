The racecamp that Jessica, Gonzo and Flora went to had a whatsapp group where organizers/more responsible drivers (includes jessica) (Flora rarely appeared there) would post schedules for training/practice races/workshops involving superstars from the world of motorsports. It was divided in many racing disciplines. Stuff ranged from as niche as drivers called up from around the world to race against corruption in "Dirt racing karting" to more global stuff like the World Endurance Championship (W.E.C.). Flora was F1, Jessica was IndyCar and Gonzo was IMSA/WEC (GTE class). The facilities had a dirt course, an american style road circuit, an european style GP circuit, a dirt oval, a short oval, a Big oval and a street circuit. Stuff was huge! It spanned 2 cities in size. It had a pharmacy, several restaurants and the recruits ought to live her for 2 years before being sent away to race. They experience a gradual shift in mindset while they race and, if the talent thats seen in them is better suited for another discipline, they will get trained (A.K.A. Jessica/Flora).

The group chat also has a lounge area and up to 10 private rooms can be opened @ once.
