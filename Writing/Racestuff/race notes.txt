*Notes:*

One character is Gonzo. Wont describe him in this story. I will just write as him. I will share some details of the other, like her (*She* is a girl) psychotic episodes, her utlra deep self awareness and her teenage past as an obcessive, yet selfless and deeply passionate lover, who was also very lost in life and lonely (Like a typical "Yandere"), who finds solace in channeling her ability to theorise and obcess over the tiniest nuances into motorsports. She loves the corners... rattling, the feeling of merging with the car. She is a brilliant driver. this is her first taste of Sports car endurance racing... and she is 13th in the overall standings, with Dodge/Chrysler, the team she drives for, being just 20 points behind Chevrolet, their eternal rivals. Her being a rising star and the fact that the team director simply cannot "Take motorsports away from her... this is already such an expensive sport... the fact we could afford to give it to her... means that, if she has an episode... and she cannot reason with us anymore as the gravel proves insufficent to stop her... in time, at least... she goes out... peaceful. Her smile once she mashes the pedal, the way her hands grip the steering wheel with possessive, yet caring agressiveness, the way she just stops responding to our radio when she gets focused... is worrying... but we account for that: We have, against her permission, installed cameras inside the car. No. it does not matter what her opinion about it is. We just need to not tell her about it. We know that people with her condition absolutely cannot take the feeling of being watched, but if she has an episode... we also have telemetry for heartrate and pulse... we can just say we use *That* to monitor if she is fine. But no. it is not. Its the look in her eyes. If her mouth stops moving and she starts drooling, she is ok. Its her concentration kicking in. But... if she starts gasping shallowly, and her hands stop moving with wide eyes, its a *must* pit stop. She comes in, takes her medication, and its race over for her. She always gets really antsy when she has to leave... berating at us endlessly for the remainings of the race when (and if...) she recovers... but she knows, deep down, despite all the absurd behaviours she has in that state (like trying to climb the fence form the pitlane to the track because she is going to "Fetch her ball" Or screaming and running around the pitlane in sheer panic because her race gear is "Brimming with fire ants that bite like bullets")... that we care. She also thinks about other male drivers alot... and gets way more kick from chasing them down and staying right on their tail than actually overtaking them. So we use her as our consistent driver when we need to maintain position, her heartrate visibly going down and her expression getting way less unfocused when she gets past someone. Her times during the qualifying round in this race were... average most of the time. But when she had toe from a car in an upperclass, when "Filipe Albuquerque" Was driving in front of her, for example, even if she knew she could not keep up, as he is in a daytona prototype and she is in a GT3 grade race car, her lap times went from within 10 seconds of 2 minutes flat, to within 10 seconds of 1minute 50 seconds. Her heart rate increases, her driving... oddly, gets sharply smoother, she trailbreaks like Ive never seen before and, from the entire GTE field, she was the one with the most percentage of throttle input through The Corkscrew, when she was behind Antonio Felix Da Costa. Her name is Jessica Mata, is 22 years old, and suffers from Psychotic depression and her personality has lots of traits related to insecure attachement styles and ADHD. She also suffers from alexathymia, and that is relevant because... well... she forgets to conserve her patience and pushes hard when she sees a backmarker from the GT4 class... that she forgets she has to move on from and overtake. She also chews on the fluid hose so hard when chasing someone (Or when gnawing her teeth screaming at us because the tire pressure were, for us imperceptively, "WAY OFF DICKFACES!") She partially rips it. The thought of her almost swallowing it makes me think "My goodness... not even the fluid equipment is safe enough for her..." .... And... its hard to get her to be vocal during therapy. The car she drives is a Chrysler Viper GTS-R.

I plan on getting both Gonzo and Jessica to duel: Jessica for her Team's constructors points and Gonzo for his first podium in the IMSA championship

I think that Jessica, (Just like any (on quotes) "Yandere"-esque girl in general, to be honest) is a modernized embodyment of the princess from the Portuguese Tale "A princessa da Ervilha"

*At the 18th lap of Gonzo's 2nd stint, right at the beginning of the 5th hour, Maria shows up at the stands next to the hairpin in T1. Gonzo, as he trail brakes right from 6th to 2nd gear, takes a quick glance and somehow notices her. He mutters to himself:* "Annnnnnd theres Maria... Whats she doing in here? Hello Maria...." *And blinks his headlights as he passes by his Ex, who Felt her own heart flutter, that then proceeds to shout loudly: "KEEEP GOING! GOOO! GOOOO! THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!"* *He was not able to catch her cheer though, as she was too naive about motorsports to understand how loud it is inside a race car engine*

*At lap 54, Jessica is on the second lap of her first stint... and is in 10th position and closing in on 9th... wasting away loads of rubber... with her Coach resignedly telling her, every lap, over the radio: "*Sigh...* Jessica, Your gap to 9th place is now 8 seconds. You have reduced your delta by 8 tenths in the last lap... and you made up 6 seconds on this stint so far. Your tire wear is... 6.... hundred percent faster than what was benchmarked in the simulation. Copy"* *She replies: "Fuck your tirewear. I need to catch this guy now zip it! Copy!" *Her voice slightly muffled by her gritted teeth*

She wont finish the race and it will be due to a psychotic episode during the final quarter of the race... on her third planned stint... as she begins to see stuff that isnt there, and in a streak of instinct she yells in the radio: "Guys! The meds! The meds!" *Now with her voice cracking... and a teary face on the hidden cameras in the cockpit, under her helmet, that detached the visor from... due to the heat and exaustion, and the fact that it is currently 4pm and the sun is no longer in the line of sight of the drivers during any stage of the track* "We are in the california desert.... and.... and I see trees... I see trees... I... I forgot to replenish my meds on the last stint... s- sorry..." *her team coach responds immediatly* "Jessica. Come to the pits now. Youre done for today. Come in. Now. When you are okay our psychiatrist will have a word with you. Copy." *Jessica... still with a glimmer of awareness of the consequences... responds, sobbing and sniffing* "Y- yes sir!"*
*In the news... after Jessica's DNF... in the television playing in the background... as the team's mental health professionals now have to try to convince Jessica, a few minutes ago a fierce driver on the track, that "No. Your hands... do not... have less fingers than the average population. Okay? Give me one finger. How many do I have? Yes... one. Very well. Give me another... *Jessica says: "Thats two..." *Sobs** Very well, Jessica! Youre doing so well!" *In the current 4th round of the IMSA WeatherTech Sports car championship, the third driver from the Chrysler/Dodge factory team has officially withdrawn from the competition, after an incident involving complicated history of Mental Health. Her team coach will now have to present himself in court along with the driver in question, as they will get inquiried about details and the flow of the incident... as well as discuss possible causes, and wether or not he should be held responsible* *Mental health professional switches off the TV... thinking: "Jessica was clearly exausted... Her brain style burns bright and fast... I told Terry Jonhson (*author notes* hes the The coach) she strictly could not have stints any longer than 1 hour. this was her 3rd. He should have forced her *harder* off the race... he should have been sterner* *Jessica utters: "ball... I have to go get the ball" *Gets up from the chair... The Therapist knows where this is going and decides to pull her down to the chair again* "No... Jessica. We will buy you another one. Okay? We are a race team for goodness sake. We can afford another ball!" Jessica replies: "But that one was my favourite! It was red and black... Like... and it had the playing card set aesthetic going on... witht he spaces and Diamonds... I liked it" *The therapist... sighing and trying to hold down a sob* "I know, dear... but lets keep going. Now... where are we?" Jessica: "Home... right?" The doctor: "No... sweetie. Lets try again: What is outside this garage?" Jessica: "Its... its a road... and fast cars... its the race track, right?" The doctor: "Yes... very well!" *The dialogue keeps going... with cameras having been strictly prohibited from entering the pits... the Terry Johnson explicitly saying to the news reporters: "No. You cannot. Jessica is currently having an episode. If you enter she will freak out. *Tsk* just give us a break... you vultures" 

*In an interview, Sir Terry Johnson said this about Jessica Mata:*

"In life, Jessica Mata is obcessed about 3 things, one being weirder than the others: Feminine behaved Boys, (She calls them "Femboys"), Racing and making us proud and... specifically, the 1983 GTU Celica Toyota racer. She told me she had a wallpaper of it on her old Magalhães Computer (A small, utility grade model of Laptop that was meant to be sold for very attractive prices to every 1st and 2nd grade child in a Pedagogical Portuguese campaign that ran between 2007 and 2011 in an attempt to make education more technologically friendly. The computer was specially appealing to her family... which was not dirt poor... but certainly was barely scrapping middle of the park monthly household income. It was a cute little thing that any first grader can easly carry, with a 1000 by 800 pixel screen, 512 MB of ram and a single core Intel Atom processor) That she SOMEHOW kept to pristine condition to this day, during the last 10 years that shes had it. *Chuckles... nodding horizontally in amused exasperation* I cant even keep my phone screen from breaking for more than 5 months... the thing has 3 years of warranty! The girl... has such a heart of gold... and one of the things she enjoys... is racing. I dont care about her mental health... and neither does she... Im not taking racing away from her." - Terry Johnson

 

*At lap 58 of Jessica's stint, the.strategists advised Terry to switch drivers, as Jessica had already went past the 60 minute threshold the psychiatrists had asserted with the manager. Up next was gonna be Alvaro Parente... a driver who was signed with mclaren last season. Alvaro parente was cool headed, consistent and accelerated and braked like Mozzart, perfect... as Jessica had already reached 5th place now.  But... no one was gonna tell her... The co- strategist decided to "poke the bear, so to speak, taking the initiative by telling Jessica the following over the radio.* "Jessica? Box next lap. In will go our number two. Its your "dont have an episode" Pause.... please li-" "WHAT? ALREADY?! F*** YOU!" *silence for a few seconds. Jessica's downshifting, braking and accelerating can be heard... staticky v8 roaring and the whine of forced induction and straight cut transmission* "Jessi-" "I DONT WANNA!" "B-" "AND GUESS WHAT? THE SUSPENSION IS TERRIBLE! ITS EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF HOW I LIKE IT! THIS THING IS DESERVING OF A "MAN" BADGE! NO! *SNORTS* SCANIA IS BETTER! WANNA KNOW ANOTHER THING? YOU INCOMPETENT MOTHERF****** SHOULD GO BACK TO WORKING WITH KARTS! AT LEAST THOSE DONT HAVE SUSPENSIONS YOU CAN RUI-" *But then... Alvaro comes in and begins uttering at the radio* "Jessica. Leave em alone. Thats enough, Ok? Stop making a scene and come out now. Or Ill make sure you wont drive today again." "...." "....." "....." ".....*sigh...* OHHH FUCK YOU! FINE! Im going.... *incomprehensible mumbling.* *disconnects* *Alvaro at self* "Spoilled child..." Co-Strategist: "One shudders to imagine what kinds of concotions someone normal... like us... would have to take... in order to keep at the same pace as her during her whole stint... let alone the entire race..." Alvaro: "Podes crer... fonhace!... Eu já nem me meto... O Mister avisa a gaja mas ela n sai do raio do carro... olha ao menos se ela tiver im chelique pode ser que se sinta um pouco menos amarga durante esse pedaço" Co-Strategist: "No diz isso Alvaro... Come on... tenta fazer ela nao berrar tanto por favor..." Alvaro: "Pá eu.... eu faço os possiveis..."

*Jessica planned celebrations for the Super Racer Program saga*
*She wins at the daytona 24hr*
*Jessica unfastens her harnesses, gets on the window hole with the crashnet taken out... and... while still with a hand loosely on the steering wheel... raises her head, straightens her spin as much as possible... and looks around... with the palm of her hand hovering her squinted face... rotating her upper body in a sentry-gun like fashion. Then... she goes to the central grass patch... on the main kink and... does donuts and burnouts in her Chrysler/Viper GTE racer. Then... her pitcrew comes deliver her a gigantic Portuguese flag... that she waves around in a vigorous, solemn way... until she finally stops and firmly plants it in the ground... as if claiming clay for her fatherland*
*She wins at the 1000 miles of Portimão*
*Jessica unfastens her harnesses, sits on the windowhole, with the crashnet out, and runs across the main straight... while looking at the stands and throwing fists into the air for those that can catch them... looking at her fellow countryMen with commanding, yet rallying body language and look on her eyes. She does this once. then... she reaches turn one... does a sliding 180 spin, and powers up to 5th gear... until half way down the line... moment at which she stops completly... starts to do her usual burnouts and donut... *She is a IMSA driver btw... which has less flair on average than even WEC!* until she gets out of the car. Then... she goes up to the protective net separating the stands from the track... and... bows down to her people.*
*Wins at the Monaco e-prix*
*Does one cruising victory lap... not really doing anything... then goes to the pits. At the pits, she gets unfastened, heads into the track. then... at the climb, gets up from the car... does a clamp with her right hand index and thumbs...  turns her body back, putting that hand up to her squinting left eyes,  staying like that for a few seconds and then turning forward and flailing her hands casually. Then... when she gets to the finish... she hops out of the car, looks for a patch of grass, flails her iconic HUGE portuguese flag to the nearest stands and then plants it firmly on the path*


*Before the race on laguna seca began... 3 hours before... everyone was just... kinda relaxing. The race sections of teams were not even at full steam yet. Drivers that knew eachother well from karting days were chatting... (they really are different animals when on a race track) about good moments... young drivers from different classes to older drivers were getting mentorship, some teams, like cadillac and acura from the prototype class (the highest one in IMSA) were already doing briefings and splitting stints... reporters were going aroung nagging drivers in the paddock... and... Jessica Mata was on the garage... sitting on a lawn chair... after doing the warmups and taking the medications, chilling too: She was hunched over her phone... all hyperfocused and giggling and stuff... googling up photos of Fernado Alonso and going like: "Hehehehe~ Im gonna eat you up you silly, silly boy... Look at you... *zooms picture in an out... rapidly almost as if shaking him in real life* Look at you... you delicious piece of raw cow meat... youre tough as nails... I want you so much... you beautiful bastard... *speaks in a sultry tone... the team knew she was doing this... they kinda just did not care, as they were used to it. Jessica also did not really feel confortable with this side of herself... but she was so immersed she did not even know people knew...* Im gonna chase you... Im gonna chase you and eat you for breakfast, lunch and dinner and make you beg f-" *Suddently... a bunch of reporters came into the Dodge/Chrysler team garage... almost barging in... the unpolite cretins... and went up... full steam ahead... directly... *to Jessica* (who they knew was not really that compatible with interviews... but they really wanted a story... as TV audiences were going down at that time), while she  *was in senpai mode*, stuck a microphone in her face and began just... *yapping*: "Hey MS JESSICA! MS JESSICA! HOW IS THE RACE GOING?" *she "wakes up"* "AAHHH!!!! *Then.... she realizes... and, feeling very unconfortable, her eye began to visibly twitch... and she responded in a comformed, bitter tone:* Perfectly..." But they would not stop jerking her up! "WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING UP, MS JESSICA?" *Jessica replies... with cold sweats down her back and chest* "St- st- strategy... *She thinks: "Please, please go away..." She genuenly felt like if someone had barged into her bedroom at 4am* Its strategy okay? *She sarcastically thinks: "These motherfuckers really doing this to me? My god... they must have been the biggest teacher pets when younger"*" "HOW IS YOUR RIVALRY WITH THE ASTON MARTIN TEAM? AND THE PORSCHE TEAM?" "Its great" "GOOD GOOD! *They speak back to HQ: "HEy sir! She isnt giving us anything... what should we try?" *They speak back* "Tease her." "R- Really?"* Hey! Ms J- Jess-" "I hear everything by the way..." "..." "..." "..." "... Okay... so... h- have a g- good" *Alvaro Parente comes in clutch to save Jessica's privacy and the reporters from embarassing themselves even more* "Hey please leave. No one even gave you permission to enter this Garage let alone speak to the drivers. *Points away* Leave please." *doing this while appearing on camera. The reporters then... with visible begrudgement but also embarassment in their posture, leave the premisses to annoy other drivers* Gonzo... witnessing all of this... from the chevrolet pitlane... while spending his last hours with Maria, his ex girlfriend who he is friends with, and just... shakes his head... "Those guys will never change... never..." Maria: "Whats happening?" Gonzo: "*sigh...* Nothing.... just pests"*


*At lap 95, in the 3rd lap of Jessica's 3rd stint... Ryan Neville, a scottish driver, managed to maintain the 8th position Jessica achieved in the stint before his... and now the strategist was planning on letting her "rip and tear" soon. Jessica was kind of just driving passively... you know... with tire wear *only* 150% above the expected... treating the car like an absolute unpaid employe at a job they regret getting... and actually setting a *FASTEST* lap for GTE class *For the day* *While on cold tires* on her second lap. To say she felt fresh is an understatement. She had taken her meds, eaten well... taken a nap... she had been let alone to senpai a little bit... and now she felt in the zone. So... there was a big gap between her and the next car in terms of circuit sequence... the strategist was like: "Jessica?" "Yes I hear you?" *Downshifting... tire squealing... exits accelerating... she is at the first corner now* "Jessica its time. " "OMG!.... is it, tho?" "You bet it is?" "Chaser mode?" "Chaser mode" "Eat 'em up?"
"For breakfast, lunch and dinner." "Jessica like it" "Jessica?" "Yes?" "Its time to show him why he should feel scared" "Oh yes I will tie him up real good" "Jessica?" "Yes?" "Engage Yandere mode." *This sparks something in Jessica. With this sentence, suddently... a ghost spawns in the road that only jessica can see. Its teasing her, and calling her up... mockingly. And no this is not an episode. This... This is her drive on its highest setting. She lets go of all restraint and begins... absolutely driving! Hitting every apex!..... A few corners go by and you can almost feel the pain from the brakes that get absolutely lit up before every entry... with them still faintly glowing at the exit of the corkscrew... where she gets naughty and almost spins out. On the wide arching corner that follows the corkscrew, she almost slides into the barrier but is caught by the side kerb as she accelerates before the corner preceding the pitlane. She has an Alonso like strategy where, to drive as smooth as possible... she sorta smashes the throttle rapidly to emulate conventional throttle control... to the sound of Femntanyl music... turning EARLY letting the slip angle do all the work... forcing the tires to do her bidding *by force* *She yanks the steering wheel... any pro driver looking at her telemetry would think she doesnt know what she is doing... but after this... she sent a 1 minute 5 seconds lap, 3 seconds faster than the fastest lap from 3rd place... which is actually from Robby Wilson... an Aston Martin car... which had better hardware this year. She keeps chasing and chasing the ghost... getting almost reckless in yet another passage by the first hairpin... with the car half slipping, half gripping... setting a purple sector as she goes by the first checkpoint... eventually... she reaches the back of the 7th car... in just 5 laps... using the tires at a 400% the predicted rate... (team is lucky because Ryan Neville's driving prowess comes from maintaining highpace while merely massaging the tires... being able to get 50% tire wear rate while securing Jessica's position). Then... right up 7th place's tail they approach the corkscrew! Jessica thinks about it but decides to leave it for another time! *7th place is actually Oliver Simons... a Porsche driver. Porsches have been struggling with straightline speed over today... which is not the case for Jessica's Chrysler Viper* Then approach the hairpin before the mains straight Jessica breaks *just* in time before touching his Olivers bumper! *Oliver on the radio: "Guys! Who is this? Theres a lunatic on the track! lunatic! They dont know what they are doing!" "That is jessica behind, jessica. number 4 for Dodge. Number 4." "God I cant breathe! its like being chased down by a dog!" *They continue down the main straight... the porsche driver decides to try something subtle yet desperate! As he feels Jessica try to eagerly go past he moves in the way... its not considered blocking because the distance was too long! So now they approach the hairpin! Jessica fakes to the inside! He instinctively closes! But that makes him get an unfavorable, bad exit line! So NOW Jessica moved wide and as she dives to the inside at the exit she ends up along side OLIVERS PORSCHE NUMBER 6! Now at second corner! Both Along side with her on the inside into the first checkpoint! She wants to get past him! But he wont let the anemic porsche engine stop him! But The Porsche's straight line speed is his down fall as she FINALLY GETS PAST AND HE TRIES TO TUCK INTO THE SLIP STREAM OF THE DODGE THE 6 CYLINDER NA BOXER ENGINE JUST WONT GIVE HIM ENOUGH SPEED AND THIS TIME JESSICA FINALLY MANAGES TO TAKE 7th PLACE!* Oliver now on the radio: "God damn guys! Sorry! Im..." "Its okay, I repeat its okay. its a long race. heads up, heads up" *They knew it was the engines fault... the fight would have clearly kept going if it wasnt for that*
