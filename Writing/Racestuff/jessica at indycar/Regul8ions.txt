Hmpf... ill make my *own* Indy car!

They will have the 3.5L V8's with ~700hp
The chassis from 2014 (last *Raw* year)... and Ill arbitrarly say they weighed 715kg because that sounds as low as I want
They will be monocoques and carbon... oh! And they will be shaped like CART cars.
The wings will NOT have DRs, there will be NO HYBRID, BUT they will have visors.
The tyres will be up to 2025 regulations
There will NOT BE round stage systems in races. Those suck.
The Pit lane speed limit is 40mph
Side draft will do NOTHING
Dirty air will be a substantial factor
The engines will sound GOOD. (Vibrating noticeably & everything when the room is quiet)
