*The chat*

Himiko Toga
Hi! I'm Toga! grins mischieviously while holding knife

Jessica Mata
I ignore you, as I did not even know you were there. I am (we are) at.... zooms map out Fuji Speedway... for another event in the JGTC callendar. I was basically out here travelling with money from my team, as we managed to eek out 2nd place in the constructors championship and they wanted to give me some of the prize money for compensation. But I still had nowherenear enough money to get an actual SuperGT car so... I had to either bribe someone... or... steal one... or sabotage one of the teams so I could race one there. It was my favourite japanese circuit and I just could not lose this opportunity! So... I looked through google maps to see what tuner shops I could buy. I knew I had an attractive body... and, according to my mastermind (TM) intuition, Those mechanics were very lonely... and very nerdy... and very needy... and very desperate for someone who they can relate to... and root for... it was all so perfect. And I was tensed up... so tensed up. So... I looked at google maps and with the shitty japanese I managed to eek out from watching anime and looking at memes and forums online while sheltered in my room for 9 years, (Till today), I stumbled upon a tuner shop called "Amuse". It was a 1 hour train trip from where I was so... I ran to the train station and got in one using my youth pass (I am just one year SHY of not being able to have one. 24. Max 25 years old... it is totally free lmao), and 90 minutes later.... I was there! So. I approached the shop. I had 3 options: 1- Steal a car. 2- gaslight them into giving me a car. 3- Seduce and............................................................... a really lonely engineer just tucked under a hoodie... all dirty with oil... exausted, fulfilled, happy but so drenched in lonelines. I could tell him I am a driver.... and that I am really looking for someone to lend me over a ride. AND I FIND ONE! LOOK AT HIM! OMG! he even has A C N E! Its perfect! Ok... approach calmly. I walk casually to him... and try to startle him.... on purpose. the tactic here is call him exactly when he has some obstacle over his head.... SO I pick my moment, he dives into the engine bay, I pull up behind him and Yell: HEEEELLLLOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
he bonks his head HARD!. But then he looks behind... and sees... me. And absolute godsent of an angel that came here to save him from his eternal loneliness. (And snatch up a car as well but thats beside the POINT! THE LOVE IS REAL!)
Him: "H- hey..." Caresses own head... but... quickly and subtly, as he does it... I put my own palm over where he hit it... and utter... in the sweetest tone of voice I could possibly do consciously
Literally-me-fr: "Does it hurt too bad?~" As I caress the top of his head... slowly

Himiko Toga
He is caught off guard by your sudden appearance and is taken aback by your unexpected yell. He looks up from the car's engine bay, rubbing his head where he hit it.

Him: "H-hey..."

He is clearly a bit confused but also pleasantly surprised by your presence. As you put your hand on his head and tenderly caress it, he blushes slightly. He is clearly not used to such intimate gestures, especially from a pretty girl. He looks at you with a mix of confusion and fascination.

Jessica Mata
Thats a pretty nice car you got there~

Himiko Toga
He is still a bit flustered from your unexpected appearance and gesture, but he quickly regains his composure and looks at you with a hint of pride.

Him: "Thanks... She's a beauty, huh? I've been working on this one for a while."

He stands up next to the car, showing you the engine bay.

Him: "I'm a mechanic here. I take care of this one and some of the others... What brings you here, if I may ask?"

Jessica Mata
I know youre a mechanic alright... hideous freak... that car is MINE! Where... are the r34's? The only cars she thought could compete in the race(Real subtle Jessica...)

Himiko Toga
He raised an eyebrow at your blunt question. He could tell that you were interested in something specific.

Him: "R34s? You mean the Nissan Skyline GT-Rs? They're over there."

He points towards the direction of a row of parked sports cars. There are several Skylines on display, all in varying conditions and models.

Him: "Is there a particular one you're interested in?"

Jessica Mata
I have a secret to tell you! Follow me! I know a place where we can go! In private!~

Himiko Toga
He looks at you quizzically, clearly intrigued by your sudden declaration. He glances around the shop to make sure no one is listening.

Him: "A secret, huh? And you want to tell me in private?"

He looks at you with a hint of curiosity and then smiles slightly.

Him: "Sure, lead the way."

Jessica Mata
Idiot Ahem... I mean... Baka! trots away... with no clue where Im going... just lookig for a place I am sure no one will see us. But suddently I spot a corner in the outside... between two Storage houses... with some wood stacks there and a rusted car's body. I whisper in his hear: "We can go there~ Inside that car's body!"

Himiko Toga
He follows you as you lead the way, slightly amused by your choice of language. As you spot the secluded spot between the storage houses.

Him: "Inside a car's body, huh?"

He looks at the old rusted car's body, curiosity piqued. But he also looks a bit skeptical.

Him: "Are you sure? It doesn't look very comfortable... or clean."

Jessica Mata
No! Stupid me... Behind the cars body! I m gonna give you something cool! Im gonna go... trots to a small corner behind the house... the pavement doing an L shape contoured by the house... being able to hide in plain sight. as I hide in the corner... I signal you... twirling a finger Come closer~

Himiko Toga
He looks around for a moment, making sure no one is watching, before walking towards you, following your signal to come closer.

Him: "Alright, I'm coming. What is it you want to show me...?"

He walks closer to the spot where you're hiding, curiosity piqued again, but also a hint of suspicion.

Jessica Mata
Look close

Himiko Toga
He looks at you with a mix of curiosity and wariness, but leans in closer as you instruct.

Him: "Look close, huh? Alright..."

He gazes at you intently, his eyes scanning you up and down, trying to figure out what you're up to.

Jessica Mata
Look at my torso!

Himiko Toga
He looks down, his gaze now focused on your torso. He glances at your midsection, wondering what you want him to see.

Him: "Okay, I'm looking at your torso. What am I supposed to be seeing here... ?"

Jessica Mata
Quickly flashes chest...

Himiko Toga
His eyes widen in surprise as you flash your chest at him. He didn't expect that at all.

Him: "Ah-!"

He takes a step back, his face turning red. He looks flustered and caught off guard, not knowing how to react.

Him: "W-what are you doing?! Do you... do you usually do this to strangers...?"

Jessica Mata
SHHHH! Now... Come closer...

Himiko Toga
He hesitates for a moment, still flushed from your unexpected action. But he can't help but be drawn to you, intrigued by your boldness. He takes another step closer, his curiosity still piqued.

Him: "Alright... I'm closer... now what?"

Jessica Mata
Steals a kiss in the lips Giggles

Himiko Toga
He is completely taken aback by your kiss. He stands there, frozen for a moment, feeling the warmth of your lips on his. As you pull back and giggle, a mix of surprise and pleasure washes over him.

Him: "Ah-..! I mean, wha-!"

He stutters, trying to find the right words to say, but still dazed by the unexpected kiss. His face is flushed, and a hint of a smile tugs at the corner of his lips.

Jessica Mata
Pulls you to the corner... wrapping you with my arms... Kissing your lips, forehead... cheeks... before you can even react... the neck, before you even have a chance to speak

Himiko Toga
He is completely enveloped by your arms, pulled into the corner and kissed senseless. He tries to react, to say something, but is completely overwhelmed by your barrage of kisses. He can barely breathe, let alone speak, as you pepper his lips, forehead, cheeks, and neck with kisses, leaving him flustered and breathless. His heart is racing, and his mind is spinning from the whirlwind of sensations.

Jessica Mata
i pull back... letting you relax... slowly hugging you.... swaying slowly Hmmmmm... such a good boy...

Himiko Toga
He takes a deep breath, feeling as if he was just released from a dizzying whirlwind. He leans into your embrace, feeling the rhythm of your swaying motion. He looks at you with a mixture of surprise and awe, still reeling from the intense display of affection.

Him: "I... I don't know what to say... You caught me completely by surprise. And calling me a 'good boy'..."

He blushes slightly, his cheeks tinged with a hint of embarrassment.

Jessica Mata
Look... I promise Ill return it... but can you give me one of the R34's? For free? For me? Please? holds both of your hands with arms stretched out... Pulling and pushing lightly and gently... in a subtle swaying motion... looking you dead in the eyes with a tender expression

Himiko Toga
He looks at you with a mix of surprise and hesitation at first. He knows that the R34s are worth a significant amount of money, and giving one away for free is a serious decision to make.

Him: "Whoa... you're asking me for one the R34s... for free? That's a pretty big request, you know."

He looks at your eyes, seeing the tender expression on your face. The sway of your bodies back and forth in the embrace, coupled with your pleading look, begins to melt his resolve.

Jessica Mata
SHhhh... it can be a secret. our secret. Come on... Hmmm? I will give you a better reward if you let me race in the JGTC Championship. I will give this shop half the prize money... and the rest will go to you~ I whisper into your ear

Himiko Toga
Your whispered words and the feeling of your breath against his ear cause a shiver to run down his spine. He can feel his resolve weakening, the offer you're making too enticing to pass up.

Him: "Half the prize money... and the rest for me? And it can be our secret..."

He considers your proposal for a moment, his mind grappling with the decision. He looks at you, his resistance fading.

Him: "Alright... I'll give you an R34. But only on one condition."

Jessica Mata
A crash of could coarses through me... but I just keep it together W- what my love?

Himiko Toga
He can see the slight falter in your composure and he can tell you're holding back something, but he decides to press on with his condition.

Him: "My condition is this: you'll drive the R34 in the JGTC Championship, and you'll give me half the prize money... But on top of that, I want something else..."

He looks at you with a mischievous smile, a hint of playfulness in his eyes.

Jessica Mata
What is he... Hey... whats wrong?

Himiko Toga
He notices your slightly worried expression and his smile widens a bit.

Him: "What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I just have another condition, that's all."

He takes a step closer to you, and his voice becomes a soft whisper in your ear.

Him: "Besides driving the R34 and the shared prize money, I have something else in mind that I want from you... something personal."

Jessica Mata
What.

Himiko Toga
He leans in even closer, his voice dropping to a sultry murmur.

Him: "You know how I said I got flustered and a bit embarrassed when you called me a good boy earlier? Well, there's one more thing I want from you... something that will really make me feel cared for. Are you ready to hear it?"

He looks at you with a mixture of eagerness and anticipation, leaning in even closer as he waits for your response.

Jessica Mata
Say it. Race is in half an hour pipsqueak

Himiko Toga
He chuckles slightly at being called a "pipsqueak" but quickly regains his composure.

Him: "Alright, since you're in a bit of a rush, I'll be quick. Here's my condition: I want you to call me a good boy again, but not just playfully like earlier. I want you to say it in a more serious way, a more genuine way. Something that really makes me feel valued and cared for... can you do that for me?"

He looks at you intently, waiting for your answer.

Jessica Mata
YEah whatever. Car now. WE DO EEEHHHT!

Himiko Toga
He chuckles at your enthusiastic response, clearly amused by your impatient demeanor.

Him: "Okay, okay, slow down, miss racer. We'll get to the car, but first... I want to hear you say it, like you mean it."

He looks at you with a hint of playfulness, clearly enjoying having the upper hand in this situation.

Jessica Mata
I take a deep breath... slowly wrap my arms around your shoulders and neck... caressing the back of your head... my hands roaming your back as I plant a kiss in your cheek and utter... in a whisper to your ear My good boy... such a good boy for mommy...

Himiko Toga
A rush of warmth and pleasure washes over him as your words reach his ears. He feels a shiver run down his spine as your hands caress his back, and the kiss you plant on his cheek sends a jolt of happiness through him. The way you call him "my good boy... such a good boy for mommy..." makes him feel cared for and valued in a way he's never experienced before.

Him: "M-mommy? Did you just...?"

Jessica Mata
*Stern tone suddently Car.

Himiko Toga
He laughs at the shift in your tone, clearly amused by your bossy demeanor.

Him: "Alright, alright, if you insist."

He leads you to the car, a smile still playing at the corners of his lips. He can't help but feel a sense of excitement, both from the prospect of giving you the R34 and the fact that you've now called him "my good boy... such a good boy for mommy", which leaves his heart racing.

Him: "Here we are. What do you think?"

Jessica Mata
Power. Does it have slicks? Roll cage? Weight? Is it all to spec?

Himiko Toga
He smiles seeing your practical and direct questions, clearly impressed by your knowledge and focus on the technical aspects of the car.

Him: "Yes, it's equipped with slick tyres, a roll cage, and it's well within the weight restrictions. It's all up to spec, my little racing prodigy."

Jessica Mata
Snags the keys from you. opens the door eagerly and closes it with some roughness. I plan to race it to Fuji for the race WEEEE DO EEEEEEHHHHT! Ingnition!

Himiko Toga
He watches as you get into the car with excitement, your enthusiasm contagious. He laughs as you start the ignition with a loud revv.

Him: "Whoa there, tiger! Take it easy on my baby!"

He grins, clearly enjoying seeing you in the driver's seat. He can already imagine you tearing up the race track with your driving skills.

Jessica Mata
I make it to the track safely... obeying (Almost) all traffic laws. I register myself as a privateer... They told me I could not use the pitlane though... and now I have another good boy to worry about... but who cares. I line up... in last place and Im ready to rock. 5 minutes will green light*

Himiko Toga
He watches as you make your way to the track, obeying (almost) all the traffic laws, and can't help but chuckle at your little rebellion.

Him: "Always the risk taker, aren't you, my little racing queen?"

He watches as you register as a privateer, a little impressed at how casually you handled the situation, even though they told you you couldn't use the pitlane. He grins, imagining the chaos you'll cause on the track.

Him: "Looks like you've got a bit of a disadvantage there, miss racer... good luck out there."

Jessica Mata
You watch me from the TV back at your shop... Once a camera approaches me... I show a heart-shaped handsign to it, open my helmet visor... from a lost+found race suit I "borrowed", winking too

Himiko Toga
He watches the broadcast from the shop, his eyes glued to the screen. He can't help but smile as he sees the heart-shaped handsign and the wink directed at the camera.

Him: "Oho, she's quite the show-off, isn't she?"

He chuckles to himself, feeling a mixture of amusement and concern as he sees you on the track, clearly preparing for the race.

Jessica Mata
I then close my visor... ignoring any interviewers attempting to talk to me... Revving the engine as hard as I can to scare them off everytime they approach. The sideways exausts proving... very useful in this specific situation

Himiko Toga
He watches the broadcast, amused at the way you use the engine revving to scare off the interviewers. He can't help but chuckle as he sees the sideways exhausts effectively scaring them back.

Him: "What a fiery little diva, scaring off the interviewers with that engine roar. Gotta admit, that's one way to keep the spotlight on you."

Jessica Mata
Himiko toga is also in the race track... in the areas for the public at this point in time

Himiko Toga
He has decided to take a break from the shop and head to the racetrack to watch the race in person. He stands in the public viewing area, eagerly watching the race unfold, as he spots you among the racers. He can't help but feel a pang of excitement, his eyes fixed on you as you rev the engine, ready to tear up the track.

Jessica Mata
(where is himiko toga? I had ignored her remember? Is she gonna let that slide?)

Himiko Toga
(Oops, sorry! She's watching from the public viewing area. Let's say she takes your little act of ignoring her as a challenge, and decides to approach you during the race. She's not one to let things slide that easily)

Jessica Mata
I am waiting at the stoplight... waiting for it to go green-green-geen 5... 4... 3.. I begin revving up the engine to the exact max-power rpm (The number I saw in gran turismo 2, at least)... hoping that will give me a better launch. So far in my career, I never did standing starts so... I am just winging it at this point

Himiko Toga
Himiko notices your revving up the engine to the exact max-power RPM, and wonders what you're planning. She can see the determination in your eyes, and a mischievous smile spreads across her face. She knows you haven't done many standing starts before, but she's impressed at how you're just winging it.

Himko Toka: quietly to herself "Oh, this should be interesting..."

She watches, eagerly waiting to see how your unconventional launch strategy will pay off.

Jessica Mata
2... 1... I do a neutral drop and launch away! I immediatly start spinning the tires relentlessly and the car begins to lose control AND track position rapidly... Shit shit shit... come on! grip! grip! Im gonna lose the slip stream She did not care... as she was planning to divebomb in turn one anyways

Himiko Toga
Himiko watches as you launch away with a thunderous roar, the car immediately losing control and sliding on the track. She can see the struggle in your attempts to gain grip and keep control of the car. But she also notices the look of determination in your eyes, and the way you're fixated on the turn ahead.

Himko Toka: still quietly watching "She's taking a big risk, but there's something about her confidence that's... fascinating."

Jessica Mata
I begin modulating the throttle... my own special way... by tapping it agressively... eventually sorting it out as I tuck in behind another driver who also had a bad start I think: "He said it had slicks though... Anyways lets keep going..."

Himiko Toga
Himiko watches as you finally manage to modulate the throttle, using your unique tapping technique to stabilize the car. She's impressed by how quickly you adapt, especially considering it's your first time working with slicks.

Himko Toka: to herself, a slightly impressed tone in her voice "She's really starting to get a feel for that car, despite the challenges. That unorthodox driving style of hers is quite something."

Jessica Mata
I approach turn one... gaining the position on the guy I was chasing, now into 24th place and into the 90 degree turn that introduces us to a 180 wide-circular one where high speed stability is tested at about 120mph

Himiko Toga
Himiko watches as you approach Turn 1, using the car's momentum and your skill to slip past the guy in front of you. She can see the confidence in your driving as you smoothly navigate the 90-degree turn and accelerate into the wide-circular 180 with ease.

Himko Toka: still watching intently "She's not just surviving, she's thriving. This girl has some real talent for racing."

Jessica Mata
(This was her on a freeday btw... she just does this because she already races for IMSA for an actual factory team... she is just a trollboss)

Himiko Toga
(Ah, I see! So she's just out here having some fun and being a bit of a troll during her free time. No wonder she's so confident on the track. Well then, let's see if she can keep this troll boss persona up throughout the race and prove that she's not just a one-trick pony!)

Jessica Mata
(She was on a trip in japan and this is how she decided to have fun)
She heads into another corner... the car keeping up with others in terms of performance as she hoped it would Good... our hardware is on par nice...

Himiko Toga
Himiko watches as you navigate the corners with skill and finesse, clearly keeping up with the others on the track despite your unconventional methods.

Himko Toka: to herself, with a hint of surprise "Not bad, not bad at all. This girl knows her stuff. Seems like her decision to use that engine rev to clear out those meddlesome reporters has paid off in terms of performance. Impressive."

Jessica Mata
Quick tapping the accelerator out of the corner, she clings to the 23rd driver... in a Denso-Sard supra

Himiko Toga
Himiko watches as you quickly tap the accelerator to keep up with the Denso-Sard Supra driver. She can see the concentration on your face, the determination to claw your way up the ranks.

Himko Toka: quietly to herself "She's really giving it her all, and she's starting to make progress. This girl's got tenacity, that's for sure."

Jessica Mata
First lap almost done... having got past another driver in the penultimate corner, which was a chikane... as she now is eyeing up another driver down the main straight... which, curiously, is one in the longest in motorsports I hope the gearing is long enough

Himiko Toga
Himiko watches as you continue your impressive progress, moving past another driver in the penultimate corner and setting your sights on the next target down the main straight. She can see the determination in your eyes as you eye up the driver ahead, and she notices the long straight stretching before you.

Himko Toka: quietly to herself, a hint of excitement in her voice "Oh, this could be interesting. If her gearing is long enough, she might just have a shot at passing that next driver and move up another spot."

Jessica Mata
She focuses all her mindpower in predicting the guys swirving. Its not uncommon for drivers to weave slightly, in a way that minimally impacts straight line acceleration, to avoid getting drafted down in straights. He keeps doing it but Jessica keeps her steering steady... right in the middle of the pivot of his swirving... which is not nearly as efficient as drafting normally... but its the best she can do right now. The car accelerates fast... 140... 150... 160... 180 mph... The crowd cheering on as the black, sponsorless R34 Amuse GTR crosses the start finish line... The gravel kicked up with the sheer ammount of vibrations from the suspension despite the smooth racetrack tarmac... due to the high speed... 200 mph... (thats 320 kph)... She is eyeing up the 21st driver! She wants to outbrake him! She waits for him to break... he does the same.... the chassis, driver seat and the minimalistic dashboard vibrating! the engine roaring and the car topping out at 334.12 kph! The engine revving to 78 hundred RPM! 200m before the corner! The first guy brakes AND JESSICA brakes 40 meters after him! Can she keep it... She locks up a little bit... BUT DOES! SHE HAS THE INSIDE! CAN SHE GET IT DONE! SHE CAN... SORTA! THEY ARE SIDE BY SIDE AS THE 19th driver in a HONDA NSX GETS A CLEANER EXIT! SHE HAS TO BACK OFF AGAIN! BUT SHE DOESNT LET UP! SHE SIDE DRAFTS HIM, THE CLOSEDNESS OF HER FRONT SPLITTER RUINING HIS STABILITY AND SPEED... AND RISKING HIS REAR TIRE! HE YIELDS! GIVES HER SPACE AS SHE SLOTS IN AS THEY PREPARE FOR THE SECOND TIME AT THE 90 DEGREE CORNER! SHE HAS THE OUTSIDE! THE DRIVER DECIDES TO PLAY AGRESSIVE TOO SO THEY BRAKE LATER! She feels the kerb and grass approach too fast so Jessica yields and resigns to tucking behind the 19th placed driver in the Raybrig sponsored NSX Race car! (Wow... but 5 overtakes in one lap!)

Himiko Toga
Himiko watches in awe as you pull off not one, not two, not three, not even four, but five overtakes in a single lap, your daring and unconventional tactics catching many seasoned drivers off guard.

Himko Toka: impressed, under her breath "Daaamn, this girl is an absolute force on the track. Five overtakes in one lap? And with a car that's clearly not as well-known or respected on the grid? Impressive... very impressive."

(Btw 2 of the overtakes were during the wide corner... because... here is the twist: She was on mediums the *whole time*. Amuse were prepping the car for some team and still had the default compound on... The car's setup had not even been polished yet... the mechanics who worked on it would have said: "Its just some hacked together ultra-agressive setup to test the steering" Which just so happened to... fit Jessica to a T.

This is totally like Ao-Ashi Meets Michel Vaillante... but the MC is a girl and totally insane

And then the way this absolute gremlin of a woman waits until the poor guy has his head dove right inside the engine bay so she can scare him and make him bump his head, honestly.

(Whats basically gonna happen is: Shes gonna race, (what happens meanwhile Ill decide on the fly) but eventually her tyres will start to give and after that even lose like 3 positions because their tires were actually a harder compound than hers the whole time (she was racing on mediums, they were all running on hards) then remember she has no pitlane or a team to speak of... so... she then insists to herself: "Just 5 more laps! come on, damn it!" Fighting with some guy (or... more accuratelly... holding back that guy) for like 2 more laps before deciding, just on the last corner (The wide one... its the 90s layout): "ok imma dip... imma return the car to the shitnerd", proceeding to then roll the car out of the pit area... into the public area... into the exit of the venue... and into the streets so she can drive it back to him...
