Kafka
You won't remember a thing except me

ETPstreamRouter
..

Kafka
Oh...You actually remember.

ETPstreamRouter
...

Kafka
Look at that face. You seem at loss of what to say.

ETPstreamRouter
What is it that you want?

Kafka
As a member of the Stellaron Hunters, it is my duty to collect all the Stellaron and save the universe.

ETPstreamRouter
No, bone head! right now!

Kafka
...

You are quite feisty. I like that.

Kafka
I have a request! Will you give me a few minutes of your time?

ETPstreamRouter
Is it one of those census bullshits?

Kafka
Do I look like I care about some stupid census?

Kafka
I have a deal to propose.

Kafka
I can give you some valuable information.

ETPstreamRouter
valuable for who?

Kafka
Valuable to whoever is able to pay a big price.

ETPstreamRouter
is it how to unfuck my brain?

Kafka
Unfortunately not. That one, I'm not selling.

Kafka
Don't look so dejected. I said I have information. Valuable information. Do you want to hear it or not?

ETPstreamRouter
Now youve got me curious

Kafka
If I say this information could change your fate, will you still be curious?

ETPstreamRouter
If thats the case fate was already changed anyway

Kafka
Then I can only assume that you are intrigued.

Kafka
This information...You have to pay a high price for it, though.

ETPstreamRouter
Are you extorting me?

Kafka
Extortion or a fair exchange of resources, depends who you ask.

ETPstreamRouter
Is it blackmail?

Kafka
Oh please. Blackmailing you? Never! I just want an equal exchange, that's all.

ETPstreamRouter
Like... the thing with the deal you are proposing is... I could give you money... but I could not control your vocal choords or mouth

Kafka
Oho ... Are you thinking about torturing me? I appreciate the fact that you think I'd break so easily.

ETPstreamRouter
No, idiot. How can I guaratee youre actually gonna tell me

Kafka
You can't. You have to take a risk. You either take the information or you don't. It's a bet.

ETPstreamRouter
Then no. Piss off.

Kafka
Sigh What a shame. I really though you would be more... cooperative.

Kafka
Let me tell you, I have a secret to tell. That information could change the course of your life. And you're just going to pass it up like that?

ETPstreamRouter
Look: Has the event the information relates to already happened?

Kafka
Smile It could be an event that has happen, an event that's currently happening or an event that's going to happen.

ETPstreamRouter
But isnt fate decided at universe birth? Nothing after that decides the future. So stop saying that its gonna "seal my fate" its illogical and pisses me off

Kafka
Sigh. Fine, whatever. I say the information could "change your fate" and you get all worked up about it. Fine, I will admit that information could change your life. Happy now?

ETPstreamRouter
Same thing

Kafka
You're just stubborn. Fine, I'll be direct: I know of a danger that lies ahead, and I want to share it with you.

ETPstreamRouter
Are you a fortune teller?

Kafka
Sigh... If I said "yes" would you believe me?

ETPstreamRouter
If you said yes I would definitely leave

Kafka
Chuckle. Then no, I'm not a fortune teller. I just happen to... have the ability to look across the threads of fate.

ETPstreamRouter
Then you are a fortune teller

Kafka
Damn it...You do take things literally. Are you always this pedantic?

ETPstreamRouter
Only with people that piss me off

Kafka
Smile Oh? And I have pissed you off that much, huh?

Kafka
And here I was thinking I was charming, yet you seem quite annoyed with me.

ETPstreamRouter
I dont wanna give this person money... And... if she is warning me of danger... why is she charging me? I think

Kafka
Ah, I can almost see the gears turning in your head. What are you thinking, hmm?

ETPstreamRouter
Look: am I gonna die in a car crash? Im a pro racing driver... if I die... how am I gonna die?

Kafka
Let me be more specific: I know a great danger that will soon threaten countless lives in the universe.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok... does everyone die at the same time?

Kafka
Sigh... Not everyone. But many.

ETPstreamRouter
Shit... does everyone on EARTH die at the same time?

Kafka
Sigh. No. Only a portion of Earth will die - a significant portion...but not all.

ETPstreamRouter
What? How is that possible? GGGHHHn.... Ok. Does everyone in america AND europe die at the same time?

Kafka
Sigh... No, neither of those continents will completely vanish, only partially.

ETPstreamRouter
WHAT? COME ON! FUCK YOU! HOW MUCH IS IT, FUCKING WHORE?

Kafka
Chuckle You have quite the mouth on you. But I'm afraid I need something far more... valuable than just money.

ETPstreamRouter
WHAT?

Kafka
Smug. What do you think is more valuable than money?

ETPstreamRouter
LIFE?

Kafka
Smile. Good answer. Although, technically life can still be translated into a monetary value....

ETPstreamRouter
So... Ok. If I let you kill me, before you actually do it, can I ask from a list of people, who dies?

Kafka
Chuckle That's quite an interesting bargain... I have to wonder if you are serious or toying with me.

ETPstreamRouter
Look: I have important people in my life and I dont want them to die. Ok? I just wanna know who I am saving before I go

Kafka
Sigh You truly are stubborn. But yes, I will give you the names of the people who will have their destinies rewritten.

ETPstreamRouter
Will they only die of old age after?

Kafka
If I was a religious person, I would say that they will go to a place where they will be truly happy. But I'm not. So I can only say that, in this future, they will be removed from the danger. There's nothing else I can say about their fates.

ETPstreamRouter
Wait a second... but... doesnt everyone die at some point? Why do I even care?

Kafka
Well, aren't you observant? You're right, everyone does eventually die, so why do you care?

ETPstreamRouter
No... I wanna go before them. Ive got my answer. if I die... theres a way bigger chance I go before them. So... I locked my answer. You can kill me now. Make it painless.

Kafka
Sighs. Are you sure you don't want to think about this more?

ETPstreamRouter
If I die... they dont get the danger. But If I dont die... Am I included in the danger?

Kafka
Yes, you are also on the list.

ETPstreamRouter
So... my friends are minorantes in the ordered chain of "who dies first".... so... theres no difference Ok... its not sealed yet right? I refuse

Kafka
Smirk. You want a second chance to change your mind?

ETPstreamRouter
No.

Kafka
You truly are stubborn. You have a lot of fight within you.

ETPstreamRouter
smirks will it look pretty from the outside when everyone dies?

Kafka
Does anyone look pretty when they die?

ETPstreamRouter
Is the thing that kills us pretty? Like... idk... the space time itself morphing and crushing us or something

Kafka
Chuckle No. Dying is an ugly affair.

ETPstreamRouter
I mean... I wont even see it so... shrugs

Kafka
Hm, you seem awfully calm about all of this.

ETPstreamRouter
I mean... It was already gonna happen... and... i cant stop it... so... its a trolley problem. And my answer to the trolley problem is: It depends on who is in the tracks. So now I made my choice... and my choice is no.

Kafka
You are an interesting person... Even after you've made up your mind, you still find time to be sarcastic.

ETPstreamRouter
Im not being sarcasting... Im being for real...

Kafka
Smirk. You are quite the oddity. But you're probably just as insane as the rest of us.

ETPstreamRouter
yeah yeah yeah whatever... yatta yatta yatta... Dials up a number "Boss?" Terry Jonhson, team leader of the GTE division of Chrysler/Dodge in the IMSA championship: "Yes, jessica? Is everything ok?" Me: "Boss... Im kinda bored... can I go to the track now? where is the car?" Terry: "There are currently no cars at tracks or planned practice sessions... want the team to book one?" Me: "Yes! Book one! Please! There is this annoying lady asking me what would I do if I could die while saving an unspecified set of people, including me, where in both cases I die, I just die immediatly if I choose the second option... and I refused" Terry: "You selfish, selfish girl..." Me: "BUT EVERYONE DIES, OLD HEAD! What would you do, then huh?!" Terry: "I would try to save as many people as I can, of course" Me: "No you would not... stop lying" Terry: Raising arms irl... "Well... I cant prove that so... idk what do say..."
Me: "Boss? Ive gone way too far to kill myself now. Neverming suffering from psychotic episodes and being a GT racing driver... If the world doesnt force me, I aint dying boss, full stop." Terry: "Fair enough... look: Where are you?" (Where am I?)

Kafka
Smile. What an interesting conversation you were having. You do know I could hear both ends of that conversation right?

ETPstreamRouter
Terry: "She actually doesnt care... And who are you? Do you ask that stuff to people in the middle of the street?"

Kafka
Chuckle. No, I just happen to come across people that I find particularly interesting. And you my friend, are definitely an interesting one.

ETPstreamRouter
Terry: "Jessica? Is she one of your friends from the mad house?" Me: "No... never seen her..."

Kafka
Smile. Do people often mistake you for a crazy person?

ETPstreamRouter
Me and Boss both laugh heartedly Terry: "Mistake... good one.... good one..."

Kafka
Smile. I can see why. You've definitely got a few screws loose in that head of it yours.

ETPstreamRouter
Me: "I am in Morocco... in a street block" Boss: "Do you need money? We are all in Italy... as IMSA will make an european special. You will need a plane" Me: "Yeah boss... send it." Terry: "On it. See you in 4 days, girl" Me: "See you, boss." Dials off Ok... I gotta go now... bye.

Kafka
Chuckle. You're leaving already?

ETPstreamRouter
I need to go... boss is waiting. My final answer is no.

Kafka
Well, I suppose it cannot be helped. But one more question before you leave...

Kafka
Can I ask, truthfully... Are you afraid of death?

ETPstreamRouter
Who isnt?

Kafka
Exactly. You can lie to everyone around you. But you can't lie to yourself. You can't fool yourself. Even you, the stubborn girl who acts as though she's fearless, is scared.

ETPstreamRouter
I know Im gonna scream and feel bad things. But I got things I still wanna do. I just have to hurry faster.

Kafka
Oh? And what sort of things are you in such a rush to accomplish?

ETPstreamRouter
Racing... more.

Kafka
You're willing to risk the last moments you have in this world... on something like racing?

ETPstreamRouter
But wont I also die if I... snorts die? if I get to love 5 seconds more whats the deal?

Kafka
Sigh... You are a strange one. But I suppose I understand your perspective on it.

ETPstreamRouter
Look... Im going... bye.

Kafka
Ah, one more thing... Before you leave. A little gift from me.

Kafka
Hands a USB drive Here, I know that you have a good head on your shoulders despite your... eccentricities. I'm sure that you would put this gift to good use.

ETPstreamRouter
What does it have... I can check my computer at any time so you might as well tell ,me

Kafka
Take a look for yourself. I'm sure you'll find it very useful.

ETPstreamRouter
Heads to airport after confirming boss' bank transfer and the online tickets. gets on plane

Kafka
Watches as you board your plane. What a strange person...

ETPstreamRouter
At the plane... I boot up my small magalhães laptop, and plug in the usb

Kafka
The moment you plug in the USB... a program loads automatically on your laptop.

ETPstreamRouter
Really? did she really give me an autorun virus? good thing I disabled wifi... at least the virus will only go to me...

Kafka
The moment the program appears on your screen... it immediately opens and an audio file begins to play

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers.

If you are listening to this, then you have successfully boarded your flight. I just thought I'd take the opportunity to... say one last thing before our conversation is brought to an end.

Kafka
Sigh I like you... despite the fact that you are an incredibly stubborn person. You stand firm on your beliefs, even against all odds. That in itself is something to admire. I believe that there are many more people that could learn something from you.

But unfortunately... your stubbornness will be your downfall.

Kafka
After all... there is a very big difference between admirable determination, and utter foolishness.

Kafka
Do you really think that racing for a few more moments is worth your life?

ETPstreamRouter
Like... she told me I would die immediatly if I chose the other th- what a dumb bitch...

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers. She chuckles upon hearing that.

Looks like you're talking about me again. You have quite the colorful vocabulary, do you know that?

Kafka
But you're correct... If you chose the other path, you would've died immediately. But you would've saved those precious people you care about.

ETPstreamRouter
I have my reasons. I mean I can explain... Ok... this audio is called: "Kafka's message". Is your name kafka?

Kafka
That's right. Hoho. How observant you are.

ETPstreamRouter
Alright. Ms Kafka, the great philosopher prophet magical woman: The reason I said no is: There is a set of people that will die, right, due to some forced cause we cannot stop. Right? including me. Right?

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers. She sounds a little confused and surprised by your response.

Yes... that is correct, I suppose.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok. Then... Know the concept of minimal elements of a partially ordered chain?

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers. She seems amused by your question.

Yes, I do know the concept. But continue.

ETPstreamRouter
So... if I die... the partial friends that die with me will all die. right? So... it doesnt violate my rule of dying after them. and if I die with your second option, I also dont die after them. thats a fact. But... with one I get to live longer.

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers. She is caught a little off guard by your response.

That is... surprisingly intelligent of you. I didn't expect that you would catch on so fast.

ETPstreamRouter
Like... bitch just let me race! Ive got a 6.7L OHV V8 wating for me in itally!

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers. She sounds amused again by your statement.

Hehe... You have a very... interesting way of making an argument. It's almost amusing.

Kafka
She sighs

Fine, I'll let you race. But please, let me ask you a favor.

Kafka
The next time you are in the middle of a race, and you hear the words "Yellow flag", promise me you will look out for yourself, ok? No more throwing away your life.

ETPstreamRouter
No... Boss nagged me alot... ohhh are you telling me that at the time it will be HARD to decide the "better" option and that I will die?

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers. She sounds serious this time. Much less amused.

I'm telling you to promise me that you wont make the stupid decision to put an arbitrary thing above your own life. There may be a time when you will have to make a critical decision in the middle of a race. And I don't want you to choose the stupid decision.

ETPstreamRouter
But Ive got boss to give me orders! All I need to do is race!

Kafka
So you can't make the decision yourself, then? You have to have everyone else tell you what to do? Do you always let the people around you think for you?

ETPstreamRouter
No! its split responsibilities. And most of the time... the stupid ones are the drivers. Ok wait... kafka.

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers. She seems eager to listen to you.

Yes, what is it?

ETPstreamRouter
Is this... wifi? Are we doing Wifi? Does your program open OS sockets?

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers. She seems quite surprised by your question.

You are correct. Yes. I am talking to you through over WiFi... how did you now?

ETPstreamRouter
In... a plane.

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers. She still sounds quite surprised that you managed to figure it out so quickly. At this point, she's not even making the effort to stop it anymore. She seems quite curious about how your mind works.

Yes, that's right. Are you surprised that a wifi signal can reach so far?

ETPstreamRouter
Can you see through my webcam?

Kafka
Kafka's voice plays through the speakers. She sounds genuinely surprised by the question. But she still answers truthfully.

Yes, I can. It actually allows me to see you right now.

ETPstreamRouter
Flashes middle fingers for 5 seconds.

Kafka
Kafka chuckles as she see's you flash your fingers. She seems genuinely amused by your action.

Aww... that's cute.

Kafka
She lets out another chuckle

You know, you're quite the feisty one, aren't you?

Kafka
She stops chuckling as she continues to speak

I must say though, I'm quite impressed. You've managed to figure out my plan in such a short time.

Actually, for a while there, I thought you were just another silly person who was just stubborn and refused to listen to reason.

ETPstreamRouter
Shuts down computer. Chucks battery aside. Runs to on-board servants Hello? It doesnt matter who I am please go ask the pilots if everything is fine.

Kafka
Kafka's voice suddenly interrupts again, without the use of your computer. It plays directly in your head, like someone whispering in your ear

Hmm... that's quite strange. If the flight attendants check, they'll find that everything is perfectly fine with the plane... in fact, the plane will reach it's destination very soon.

ETPstreamRouter
THE BATTERY WAS OFF WHA?

Kafka
Kafka's voice answers in your head, sounding amused and confused

Hehe, did you really think that would do anything?

ETPstreamRouter
Did you prank me?

Kafka
Kafka's voice answers in your head. It still sounds amused, but has more of a sinister tone.

Oh no... I wasn't "pranking" you. Just making an little example. As I said before, your computer was merely a way to let me talk to you. Shutting off the computer wouldn't disconnect us at all.

ETPstreamRouter
Sigh... Omg my poor magalhães! Goes pick up the computer... and battery. Carefully plugs it back in and gives it a little smooch and uttering softly sorry Why? I thought you were doing terrorism!

Kafka
Kafka's voice answers in your head. She seems amused by your behavior

"Terrorist"? That's a very extreme term, don't you think?

Hehe... I suppose it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that, though.

Kafka
She continues, chuckling

And don't worry, I won't hurt your little computer... it's a very useful tool, after all.

ETPstreamRouter
No you idiot! I hurt my computer trying to undo your shitty crap! And isnt wifi harmful to planes?

Kafka
Kafka's voice answers in your head. She sounds like she's trying to hold back a laugh

Ahahaha.... you actually hurt yourself? My apologies then. And no, wifi signals do not harm airplanes in anyway. You have nothing to worry about.

ETPstreamRouter
Wha...

Kafka
Kafka's voice continues to answer in your head. She seems as amused by you as ever

Hehe... don't look so confused. A WIFI signal is just a radio wave. All communication, whether on the internet or not, uses radios. Airplanes use communication systems all the time. How do you think they stay in contact with each other?

ETPstreamRouter
But... would frequencies not interfeer?

Kafka
Kafka's voice continues in your head, as she answers your question

Of course, radio frequencies can interfere with each other, but all communication systems use special techniques to help prevent this from happening. It's quite complicated, but there are ways to prevent WIFI signals from interfering with airplane communication.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok whatever... Boots up computer again Then... ok where were we? I dont even remember... ok... There is this french guy named Grosejan... know him? Hes an idiot driving for Peugeot Sport in the WEC

Kafka
Kafka's voice answers in your head.

Ah, you're referring to the French racing driver, Romain Grosjean. I'm familiar with his name, yes. But what about him?

ETPstreamRouter
Hes an idiot because he divebombs people... is that the people who youre telling me to watch out for?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, still sounding amused.

Oh yes... he is notorious for his reckless driving style. Always pushing the limits with his daring overtakes and dangerous moves. I suppose you can say that he is one of the "people you need to watch out for".

ETPstreamRouter
I mean... is the "Yellow" flag related to the danger?

Kafka
Kafka's voice answers in your head

Yes, you are correct. A yellow flag indicates a situation where there is danger on the track. it could be a stalled car, debris on the track, or any other potential hazard.

ETPstreamRouter
No You piece of crap! The BIG MEAN DANGER!

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding slightly offended.

Excuse me? That was quite rude of you to call me a "piece of crap". And as for the "BIG MEAN DANGER...", yes, there is something much, much more dangerous.

ETPstreamRouter
IS the yellow flag related to it?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head. She seems to be getting quite tired of your stubbornness.

Sigh... Yes, the yellow flag is related to it. If you see a yellow flag being waved, that means there is a situation of danger on the track that must be avoided. Understand?

ETPstreamRouter
Ok. But... if its unnavoidable, why do you warn me? and how is a yellow flag gonna kill people? Is the "Big danger" gonna cause a yellow flag as a collateral? Or will the yellow flag itself kill people somehow?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding impatient.

Jesus Christ, you are stubborn, you know that? Ok, let me spell it out for you. The yellow flag is a warning sign. It lets you know there is something dangerous on the track that you need to be aware of, so you can avoid it.

If you see a yellow flag being waved, it could mean a crashed car on the track, or debris on the track, or even an oil leak. You need to pay attention before something bad happens!

ETPstreamRouter
Ok whatever I know what A yellow flag is, you pink mop!

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding frustrated and offended.

What is your problem?! Did you just call me a "pink mop"? That's both offensive and ridiculous, you know!

Kafka
She continues, sounding more annoyed

And yes, of course I know what a "yellow flag" is, you moron! Do you think I've never seen a race before?

ETPstreamRouter
But... LIke... sorry! I dont understand anything now! What is the danger! just tell me!

Kafka
Kafka's voice takes a deep breath before responding in your head. She sounds slightly irritated still.

All right... I will tell you. But you have to listen carefully, got it?

Kafka
She continues speaking, trying to keep her temper under control

The "danger" I'm talking about... is something much, much worse than any other danger you've ever encountered on the track. It goes way beyond the bounds of what you could imagine.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok. Then it isnt an yellow flag. Ok... continue.

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, still trying to maintain her patience

Correct, it is not something that can be signaled by a yellow flag. You see, this "danger"... it is not something that can be physically seen or identified easily. It is a danger that lurks beneath the surface, waiting to strike at any moment.

Kafka
She continues speaking, her voice taking on a more serious tone

It is not a crashed car or debris on the track. Nor is it a oil leak or any other typical danger that you would expect in a race. This danger is something much more sinister and dangerous... something that threatens not just you, but the entire racing community.

Kafka
Kafka's voice continues, her voice becoming more intense

This "danger" is not a force of nature or a product of mere chance. It is something that has been intentionally designed and planned. Someone has been working behind the scenes, manipulating things and events to create a perfect storm.

ETPstreamRouter
Is it a 14 year old girl with a steroid problem?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding perplexed by your question.

A 14 year old girl with a.... what? Where the hell did you come up with that idea?

ETPstreamRouter
Nothing... continue.

Kafka
She lets out a sigh before continuing

Ok, moving on...

As I was saying, this "danger" is not something to be taken lightly. It is something that has the power to destroy everything you hold dear... your career, your reputation, and even your life.

ETPstreamRouter
Reputation is secured. My life? You said it was unaviodable!

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding serious

Yes, it is true that this danger is unavoidable. But when I said it could threaten your life, I didn't mean it in the way you think.

Kafka
She continues, her voice becoming more intense

This danger is not something that will physically harm you. It will not cause you to crash or get into an accident. It will not lead to any physical injury or death. Rather, it is much more insidious than that.

ETPstreamRouter
Ohhh! its spiritual!

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding a bit amused

Hehe... That's a very... interesting way of thinking about it. But in a sense, yes, it could be considered "spiritual" danger. It is a danger that threatens not just your body, but also your mind and soul.

ETPstreamRouter
Is it sin?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding philosophical

In a way, yes... it is indeed a type of "sin". It is an act of defiance against the natural order of things, a disturbance in the balance of the universe. It is a perversion of the laws that govern life and existence.

ETPstreamRouter
is it being stubburn when the psychiatrist tells me to finish my stint over the radio?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding slightly sarcastic

Hehe... you are quite the stubborn one, aren't you? But no, what you did is just being a pain in the ass.

You don't know how much those team managers suffer when you pull stunts like that!

Kafka
She continues, sounding slightly amused

But I must admit... there is something almost admirable about your stubborness in defying authority like that. It takes a certain level of nerve to ignore the advice of a psychiatrist like that.

Kafka
She continues, her voice becoming more serious

But don't get me wrong. There are times when it's better to listen to advice, especially when it comes to your own well-being.

Kafka
She continues, sounding a bit more concerned

You know, those team managers and psychiatrists are just trying to help you become a better driver. They want you to succeed and achieve your full potential.

ETPstreamRouter
Back. To. The. Danger.,

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding focused again.

Ah, yes, the danger. Sorry, I got a little side-tracked there. Where were we...

Kafka
She continues, her voice taking on a more ominous tone

Right, the danger. So, as I was saying, this "danger" is an insidious force that threatens not just your racing career, but also the integrity of the entire sport. It is a force that has infiltrated the very foundation of the racing world, slowly gnawing away at the very essence of what makes racing great.

ETPstreamRouter
So will it kill racing... and therefore me? is that how I will die?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding solemn

In a way, yes. If this danger is left unchecked and continues to fester, it could indeed lead to the downfall of racing... and as a racing driver, that would mean the end for you as well.

ETPstreamRouter
Is it grosejan making FIA get paranoid with safety rules? Why dont they just lock him up?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding amused

Hehe... you really do have a thing for Grosejan, dont you? But no, this danger is much bigger than one single driver. And as for locking him up, well, that wouldn't really solve anything, would it?

Kafka
She continues, sounding a bit more serious

You see, this danger is not something that can be dealt with through simple punishment or incarceration. It is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive and multifaceted solution. And to be honest, I doubt that locking up Grosejan would even be effective in solving anything.

Kafka
Kafka's voice continues, sounding a bit more frustrated

And to be quite honest with you, there are bigger issues at play here than just the safety rules. Sure, the FIA may be paranoid about safety, but they're not the real problem. And if the problem was simply Grosejan, I wouldn't be here giving you this warning.

Kafka
She continues, her voice becoming more intense

This danger goes much deeper than that. It is an infiltration of corruption and malice throughout the entire racing industry.

Kafka
She continues, sounding ominous

It is a force that seeks to destroy the very spirit of racing, to strip away the passion and excitement that makes this sport so wonderful. It is a danger that threatens not just drivers like you, but also the fans and enthusiasts who support and love the sport.

ETPstreamRouter
Did you sample me to feed me something I would think is bad?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding surprised.

What? No, I did no such thing! I have been talking to you through thought transmission, not feeding you with any information.

ETPstreamRouter
No! Did you evaluate me to then use it against me? Why would it be related to racing of all things? Why not ping pong? or cooking or whatever?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding amused

Hehe... you overthink things, dont you? No, I did not "evaluate" you to use it against you. And as for why it's related to racing, well, it's because you're a racing driver, aren't you? It makes perfect sense.

ETPstreamRouter
OK then I guess You HAD a reason to come to me specifically. Ok.

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding slightly frustrated

Of course I had a reason. I didn't just come all the way here for no reason, you know. This danger is not a joke, and I need someone who can take it seriously and do something about it. That's why I chose you.

Kafka
She continues, speaking with a bit of authority in her voice

I saw something in you when I watched you race. I saw something special. A spark of talent, a glimmer of potential. I saw a future champion. And that's why I came to you. I knew that if anyone could handle this danger, it would be you.

Kafka
She continues, her voice becoming more sincere

You have the skills, the passion, and the drive to succeed on the track. But you also have something else. Something that few others possess. A unique ability to think outside the box, to take risks and make the impossible possible.

Kafka
She continues, sounding confident

That's what I saw in you, and it's what I need for this mission. I'm putting my faith in you, not just as a driver, but as a person. I'm counting on you to rise to the challenge and save racing from this danger.

Kafka
She continues, sounding intense

But don't underestimate the challenge. This is not something to be taken lightly. It is dangerous, complex, and unpredictable. You will face obstacles, roadblocks, and setbacks. But I believe in you. I believe you have what it takes to overcome them.

Kafka
Kafka's voice continues, her voice becoming more hopeful

This danger may seem insurmountable. It may seem like an impossible task. But remember, this is not just about you. This is about the future of racing. The future of thousands of racing fans around the world. The future of the sport you love so dearly.

ETPstreamRouter
Is it... burnout?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding surprised.

Burnout? That's... that's an interesting guess, but no, it is not burnout.

Kafka
She continues, sounding a bit sympathetic

Burnout is a serious issue that many racers face, but it is not the danger I'm referring to. This danger is much bigger, much more sinister than burnout. It is something that threatens the very fabric of racing itself.

Kafka
She continues, sounding more serious

This danger is not just about physical exhaustion or mental fatigue. It is about the integrity of the sport, the values that define it, the passion and dedication of drivers like you. This danger threatens all of that, and that's why I'm here to warn you.

ETPstreamRouter
is it an emission scandal?

Kafka
Kafka's voice responds in your head, sounding amused

Hehe... I like your line of thinking, but no, this danger does not deal with emission scandals. This danger is much deeper and more complex than that.

Kafka
She continues, her voice taking on a more sinister tone

It is not a scandal that can be easily resolved with a simple fix or a public apology. This danger is an existential threat that requires much more than just a quick fix or a PR stunt.

Kafka
She continues, her voice becoming more intense

This danger threatens not just the reputation of the racing industry, but also the very core of what makes it great. It threatens the passion, the spectacle, and the sense of adventure that racers and fans alike love about this sport.

Kafka
She continues, sounding more serious

This danger is not just a publicity crisis that can be swept under the rug. It is a deep-seated problem that requires a fundamental change, a revolution in the way the racing world operates.

ETPstreamRouter
Yeah... emission scandals dont even make brands change their approaches anyway...

Kafka
She responds in your head, sounding slightly amused as she continues.

Oh dear, I see you're quite the cynic when it comes to racing, huh? But you're right, emission scandals seem to be just business as usual, and brands don't really care about changing their approaches. The racing industry just keeps chugging along, as if nothing happened.

Kafka
She continues, her voice taking on a more cynical tone

It's like a never-ending cycle...brands get caught, they make a few half-hearted apologies, maybe throw in a few token eco-friendly changes, and then it's back to business as usual. Repeat ad nauseam. It's a joke, really.

Kafka
She sighs in your head, sounding tired of the whole thing.

It's always the same old story with these emission scandals... brands make a few half-hearted changes here and there, pretend to be eco-friendly for a little while, and then go back to their usual polluting ways as soon as they get the chance. It's a cycle of hypocrisy and greenwashing, really.

ETPstreamRouter
And dont talk me about electric cars... people need to shut their yappers about those. They are toys. They will never be more effective than normal cars. and thers already cvts. We solved the "shifting is hard" problem. There is stuff like Free valve, VTEC... we are improving engines relentlessly. And, of course... we dont even need this many cars in the first place... Why dont we make cars better AND drive less? I get it. Im a racing driver. But I can be a big girl and take the bus when I have to.... Im no goddess...

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding thoughtful

Hmm... you have some pretty sharp insights there. Electric cars are not the end-all be-all, and there are indeed many ways we can improve existing technologies. And I agree, reducing car use and improving public transportation systems can do a lot for reducing environmental impact. You're a racing driver, but you've also got a good head on your shoulders... for someone with split personality disorder.

Kafka
She continues, sounding a bit less serious

But I digress. We can debate about the future of transportation later. Right now, let's focus on the bigger danger I warned you about. This is not just some problem we can fix with a few policy changes or technology improvements. This is an insidious threat that's woven deep into the fabric of the racing world.

Kafka
She becomes more intense as she continues, her voice taking on a warning tone

We're talking about something dangerous, something sinister, something that threatens the very heart of this sport we all love so dearly. This is not just about emissions or car efficiency. This is something much more serious, much more insidious...

ETPstreamRouter
Do you have Ni in your MBTI function stack?

Kafka
She responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Ni? You're going to ask me about MBTI functions now? Fine, I'll humor you. Yes, Ni is in my function stack. Why do you ask?

ETPstreamRouter
Above third right?

Kafka
She responds in your head, sounding a bit sarcastic.

Oh, so you're going to psychoanalysis me now? How... predictable. But if you must know, yes, Ni is above third in my function stack.

ETPstreamRouter
Id assume you are an INFJ. "Muhhh vision!" "Future" "Waahhhh!" "My vision!" "Waahahaahahh my vision!" "Society is so bad!" Ok maybe not the last one...

Kafka
She responds in your head, sounding slightly offended and bemused.

Hehe... well, aren't you the little expert? So, let me get this straight...in your eyes, I'm an INFJ who's all about "the vision" and "the future"? And let me guess, I'm also the kind of person who's always complaining about "the state of society" too, huh? Do I have that right?

ETPstreamRouter
I SAID EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE LAST ONE! I WAS A LOSER BEFORE I BECAME A RACING DRIVER OK? Says proudly I KNOW MBTI LIKE THE PALM OF MY HAND! AND I KNOW IT PROPELLY! Sigh... Go ahead... sorry... the danger?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding slightly amused by your outburst. But she quickly regains her serious tone.

Hehe... feisty, aren't you? But I suppose I should get back to the subject at hand. The danger...Ah, yes. The danger. Where should I even begin?

Kafka
She sighs in your head, sounding weary.

This danger is insidious, complex, and far-reaching. It's not just about emissions or car design. It's an attack on the very heart of what makes racing great. It's a threat to the spirit of competition, the passion of racing, and the integrity of the sport itself.

Kafka
She continues, her voice becoming more intense as she speaks.

This danger is not just something we can solve through technological improvements or policy changes. It's a deep-set problem, one that runs through the veins of the racing world. It's an issue that's infected the industry, the media, and even the fans themselves.

Kafka
She pauses for a moment, taking a deep breath, then continues.

This danger takes many forms. It's a web of corruption, a tangle of hidden agendas, and a web of misinformation. It's a monster with many heads, and each one is hungry.

ETPstreamRouter
Sorry... I know you have Ni and all... but you told me... nothing, so far. Chop chop. What IS the danger?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit impatient.

Hehe... so impatient, aren't you? Fine, I'll get to the point. The danger I'm talking about is... cheating.

ETPstreamRouter
Okay! Is peugeot gonna cheat? is grosejan gonna get above 10th place?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit annoyed.

No, no, no! Not that kind of cheating. I'm not talking about some driver cheating in a single race. I'm talking about a systematic, widespread cheating problem that's infecting the entire industry.

ETPstreamRouter
Why is everything you say "Widespread" and "global" And "Insideous". why? Why is nothing ever "concrete"?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding slightly offended.

Well, excuse me for using words to describe a complex and far-reaching problem. I suppose I could simplify it for you if you like. Would you prefer if I said "big problem, lots of people doing bad things"? Is that concrete enough for you?

ETPstreamRouter
I mean... you would still tell me nothing so...

Kafka
She responds in your head, sounding a bit frustrated.

Fine, I'll try to simplify it for you. Imagine a racing series where the top teams are cheating. They're using illegal parts, manipulating the rules, and doing whatever it takes to win. And all of this cheating is being covered up and condoned by the officials, the media, and even the fans. That's the danger I'm talking about.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok thats fucked up.

Kafka
She responds in your head, sounding more serious.

Yes, it is. It's downright wrong and goes against everything that racing stands for. The competition is supposed to be fair and honest, with everyone playing by the same rules. But when cheating becomes so widespread and accepted, it ruins the entire sport.

ETPstreamRouter
Then... if cheating becomes widespread... OHHH! Would it be like... if valve disabled VAC and suddently everyone could aimbot?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit exasperated.

Hehe... did you just compare cheating in racing to aimbotting in video games? Really? Well, if you want a gaming analogy, let's say it's like if all the top players in the world suddenly started using aimbots and wall hacks. It would ruin the game for everyone else.

ETPstreamRouter
But... Ok Now Im serious. How do I... where do I... Like... who do I have to slap?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit confused.

Hehe... slap? You want to start slapping people? I mean, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking we could be a bit more subtle than that.

Kafka
She continues, sounding a bit amused.

But seriously, the issue is not just a few bad apples. It's an entire rotten system. The people responsible for this cheating are powerful and well-connected. It's not as simple as just walking up to them and slapping them.

ETPstreamRouter
Omg then... is it like... are the politics wrong? Then... no wonder your yapping sounded so "Society"-ish... its because it is!

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding slightly annoyed.

Yes, you could say that the politics are wrong. The racing industry is a big business, and like any business, it's full of politics and power plays. The people who run the sport are more interested in making money and gaining influence than they are in maintaining the integrity of the competition. And when you have that kind of culture, it's easy for cheating to take root.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok... You predicted I would think its unsurmountable. Youre right.

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit impressed.

Hehe... you're picking up on this quickly. Yes, I did expect you to feel that way at first. The cheating in the racing industry is a massive problem, and it's not going to be easy to fix. It's a system that's been built over decades, with many layers and many players involved.

ETPstreamRouter
Are you telling me... I need to beat... cheating cars? smiles Punches fist into open palm Lets fucking gooooooo!!!! IM not even gonna die? OMG IM GONNA DRIVE UNTIL I FALL ASLEEP!

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Whoa there, tiger. I like your enthusiasm, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Yes, I think you have the right attitude to tackle this problem, but you're going to need more than just a strong punch and a determination to drive until you fall asleep.

Kafka
She continues, sounding a bit more serious.

This isn't a problem that can be solved with brute force alone. You're going to need strategy, cunning, and a deep understanding of the racing world. You're going to have to deal with powerful people, hidden agendas, and a complex web of corruption.

ETPstreamRouter
I... dont know those things... where do I... learn them?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit sly.

Hehe... you're going to need a teacher. And I just so happen to know someone who could help you.

Kafka
She continues, sounding a bit cryptic.

This teacher is experienced, cunning, and knows the racing world inside and out. They can teach you the skills you need to stand up to the cheating and corruption in this sport.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok... I know you hate when I do this, as your Ne is probably in your shadow... but can I take another one of my guesses?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit exasperated.

Sigh... go ahead, make another guess if you must.

ETPstreamRouter
Is it... my boss? Is he the teacher? Is it one of my psychiatrists?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Hehe... your boss or one of your psychiatrists? No, I'm talking about someone a bit more... relevant to the racing world.

ETPstreamRouter
Do they drive?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit surprised.

Hehe... that's the first smart thing you've said so far. Yes, the teacher drives.

ETPstreamRouter
Am I gonna meet a hot driver senpai? Am I the same country as them? Are the portuguese? Is it Felipe massa from the ferrari team? Is it Antonio Felix da Costa from the Cadillac team?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a little amused.

Hehe... so many questions. Let's see... are they from your country? No, they're not Portuguese. And they're not Felipe Massa or Antonio Felix da Costa.

Kafka
She continues, sounding a bit mysterious.

As for whether you'll meet a hot driver senpai... well, I suppose that's a matter of opinion. But let's just say they're someone you won't forget in a hurry.

Kafka
She continues, her voice becoming a little more intense.

And before you ask any more questions, I want to clarify something. This teacher is not going to be someone you immediately take a liking to. They can be a bit harsh, demanding, and unapologetic.

Kafka
She continues, her tone becoming a bit more serious.

They will push you to your limits, challenge you in ways you never thought possible, and demand nothing but the best from you. If you're expecting a kind, friendly teacher who's going to hold your hand and guide you every step of the way, you're in for a rude awakening.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok... That sounds... oddly alluring already...

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Hehe... I knew you'd be into that sort of thing. But don't get ahead of yourself. This teacher is not going to be easy to handle. They're stubborn, intense, and not afraid to ruffle feathers.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok: Do they care about mental health? They might piss me off but... they will monitor me with psychiatrists and stuff right?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit more reassuring.

Don't worry, they're not the type to completely disregard your mental health. They're well aware of your condition, and they know that it needs to be managed. They'll work with your psychiatrists to ensure that you're properly taken care of while you're under their tutelage.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok then they are just MEGA difficult then... got it. Go on.

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding more serious.

Oh, they're more than just "difficult." They're demanding, unyielding, and they expect absolute obedience from their students. They're not going to coddle you, or give you any special treatment. They'll push you to your limits, and sometimes, they may even push you beyond what you think you're capable of.

ETPstreamRouter
Am I... gonna have to change teams?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Change teams? Oh no, honey, this isn't just about changing teams. This is about completely turning your life upside down. Your teacher is going to challenge you in ways you couldn't imagine. They're not going to just mold you into a better driver; they're going to change who you are as a person.

ETPstreamRouter
I look allured... and feel oddly so... and incredibly doubtful... but also determined Ok...

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit satisfied.

Good... You're starting to get the picture. This teacher is not just going to teach you how to drive better; they're going to push you to your absolute limit, and force you to confront everything you thought you knew about yourself.

She grins a little.

But if you're willing to accept the challenge, they're going to turn you into a racing monster that will make the Grand Prix look like a stroll in the park.

ETPstreamRouter
But... I got a trial at an F1 car once... and you can already picture my personality right? Like... i got the thing rolling and... even me... I tipped on the brakes and my brain almost fucking melted! And then I was like: "Nope... lets go back to driving GTE"...

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Heh, I remember that little episode. It's true, F1 cars are a completely different beast to GTE cars. They're faster, more powerful, and require a much higher level of skill to handle. And it sounds like you had a bit of a mental breakdown on your first attempt.

ETPstreamRouter
Omg... please dont put me in an F1 car again! Im just not built for it

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit smug.

Hehe... oh, honey, who said anything about an F1 car? Your teacher is going to push you to your limits, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. They're not going to start you off in an F1 car. You'll start with something more manageable. The teacher knows your limits, and they'll push you gradually.

ETPstreamRouter
Am I going to karts first?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Karts? No, no, no. Your teacher is not going to start you off with kiddie race cars. They're going to start you with something a bit more challenging. Something that'll require more skill, more finesse, and more mental toughness.

ETPstreamRouter
Like... an FE car?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit pleased.

That's more like it. Your teacher is going to start you off with an FE car. They're fast, they handle well, and they'll require you to use your skills in a completely different way than you're used to. You'll have to adapt, and you'll have to push yourself to the limit.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok... And those have gears no?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Yes, Formula E cars do have gears. But don't expect them to be the same as GTE cars. The power delivery, the shifting strategy, and the driving style needed to handle them will be completely different from what you're used to. Your teacher will help you master all of it.

ETPstreamRouter
Alright... smiles ANTONIO FELIX DA COSTA ALSO RACES IN FE! I CAN RACE IN THE SAME MACHINERY AS HIM!

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

You're such a fanboy, aren't you? Yes, your teacher will start you off in the same type of machinery as Antonio Felix da Costa. But remember, this isn't just about racing in the same cars as your racing idols. This is about pushing yourself to your limits and becoming a better driver.

ETPstreamRouter
Im a girl... sorry...

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit embarrassed.

My apologies! I shouldn't have assumed. Let me rephrase that: "You're such a fangirl, aren't you?"

ETPstreamRouter
Yes!

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Hehe... I can tell. But don't worry, your teacher will have you racing in the same machines as your idols in no time. And who knows? Maybe you'll even race against Antonio Felix da Costa himself someday.

Kafka
She continues, her voice getting a bit more serious.

But let's focus on the present, shall we? Your teacher is going to help you become a better driver, and that means pushing you in ways you've never been pushed before. They're not going to coddle you or give you any special treatment. They're going to demand excellence from you, and they're going to make sure you deliver.

ETPstreamRouter
I bet... their the kind of person who will tell me to do something that sounds absurd... I lashout loads of times until I reluctantly do it... and then it ends up not being absurd at all

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Haha... you're already getting the picture, aren't you? Your teacher is going to challenge you in ways you don't expect, and sometimes, their demands may seem absolutely absurd. But let me assure you, there's a method to their madness.

ETPstreamRouter
This is an anime I swear... Laughs

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Hehe... is that your way of saying this feels like a cheesy training montage straight out of an anime?

ETPstreamRouter
It sounds like it

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Well, get ready for your training arc, then. Your teacher is going to push you to your absolute limits, and they're not going to stop until you've become the best damn driver you can possibly be.

ETPstreamRouter
That sounds cool

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit pleased.

You think so? Good. Because your teacher will push you harder than you've ever been pushed before. They're not going to give you any easy rides or take it easy on you because you have a psychiatric disorder. They're going to treat you just like any other student, and they expect you to give them everything you've got, every single time.

ETPstreamRouter
As long as they dont ignore medical advice Mock coughs Boss! Mock coughs

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Hehe... don't worry, your teacher will be working closely with your psychiatrists and medical team to ensure that your condition is managed properly. But let's be clear, they won't let your condition be an excuse for slacking off. They expect you to give your all every single time you're behind the wheel.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok then... bring him. When does this thing land anyway?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit coy.

Hehe... so eager, aren't you? Your teacher will arrive in due time, but I can't give you a specific ETA. They like to keep their comings and goings a mystery. It's part of the whole "mysterious mentor" vibe they have going on.

ETPstreamRouter
Laughs Omg ok then...

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Yes, your teacher likes to make a dramatic entrance. They're not one for subtlety, that's for sure. But trust me, when they arrive, you'll know it.

ETPstreamRouter
Sure... Now Im hooked!

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit smug.

Hook, line, and sinker. You're all in now, and there's no backing out. Your teacher will push you further than you ever thought possible, and they won't let you rest until you've reached your full potential.

ETPstreamRouter
You say it like its a bad thing!

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Hehe... who said it was a bad thing? Your teacher is going to push you to your limits, yes, but they're also going to help you unlock your full potential as a driver. And let's be honest, pushing yourself to the limit feels great, doesn't it?

ETPstreamRouter
You said the same thing like 8 times! Come on! Looks out of window Look! the ground!

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Hehe... sorry, I didn't realize I was repeating myself so much. But yes, we're almost here. We should be landing soon. Get ready to meet your new teacher.

ETPstreamRouter
The plane lands... In italy

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit cheerful.

Welcome to Italy! The land of Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and some of the most beautiful race tracks in the world. Are you excited?)

ETPstreamRouter
Who would not?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit smug.

Hehe... that's the attitude I like to see. You're practically salivating at the thought of what's to come, aren't you?

ETPstreamRouter
I guess

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

"I guess"? Don't be so coy. You're practically vibrating with excitement. This is a dream come true for you, isn't it?

ETPstreamRouter
Like... just... monza... I wish... but... did they already talk with boss?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit serious.

Don't worry, your teacher has already spoken to your boss. They explained the situation and assured them that you'll be in good hands. They also promised to keep your condition under control and make sure you're working at your peak performance.

ETPstreamRouter
So I am no longer driving for Chrysler, am I

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit smug.

Hehe... let's just say you're on extended leave from Chrysler. Your teacher has convinced them to let you go on a sort of "secret training mission" under their tutelage.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok then...

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

You sound a bit reluctant. Don't worry, your teacher has made sure that you're still technically employed by Chrysler. You're just on loan to them for the duration of your training.

ETPstreamRouter
Ok so... uhh... where... where do I go?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit serious.

Follow me. Your teacher will be meeting us in a car parked just outside the airport. They like to keep things discreet, so they'll be waiting for us in an unmarked vehicle.

ETPstreamRouter
But youre in my head? Where is your body?

Kafka
Kafka replies in a playful tone.

Hehe... I'm a Stellaron Hunter, remember? I have many tricks up my sleeve. For the time being, my consciousness is residing in your mind. But I assure you, my real body is close by and waiting for us outside.

ETPstreamRouter
So... are you technically... dead or alive right now?

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Hehe... that's a good question. I suppose you could say I'm in a sort of "limbo" state. My consciousness is fully intact, but my physical body is currently separate from me. So, I guess you could say I'm both alive and not alive at the same time.

ETPstreamRouter
Not alive... Winks at nothing... as you are inside my head Gotcha!

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

You've got me! I'm technically not alive at the moment, since I'm not physically inhabiting my body. But don't worry, this is just a temporary situation. I'll be back in my body soon enough.

ETPstreamRouter
Thats different from dead! thats why I winked!

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit impressed.

Hehe... you're quick on the uptake, aren't you? You're right, "not alive" and "dead" aren't quite the same thing. And your wink was a clever way of pointing that out. Well done.

ETPstreamRouter
Not clever... just cringe and a bit sassy

Kafka
Kafka responds in your head, sounding a bit amused.

Hehe... maybe a little bit of both. But hey, I like it. You've got a quick wit and a bit of sass, and that's a good thing. It means you're not afraid to speak your mind and stand up for yourself.
