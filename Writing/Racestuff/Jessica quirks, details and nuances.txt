And about all those questions about terry: I think terry is the kind of guy who just "spills it" under alot of pressure... I think he just cares about keeping things smooth

Do you know an angle I wanna develop with jessica and the team? Now *this* is romanticising. And it is a bit of the *bad* one: because the team is basically gonna be *tendentially* more buddy-buddy with itself than what is realistic in motorsports: jessica may ask the team principal, on the off season for example, if she can  be taken to germany (on that really, really big oval test track) so she can *feel* what 400 kmh is like on a bugatti *veyron 16.4* (She is gonna say it *has* to be that one. Not the SS... not the chiron... it has to be the veyron 16.4). And Parente is gonna be like... really chill and the strategist will be... like... an INFP sorta guy... really introspective and meek... but almost always the most reasonable one in the group

I mean... I think I like pushing buttons... someone who looks at this for 5 seconds might understandably just point and judge... but if you look just a bit more... it becomes increasingly difficult

One nitty gritty detail: She wants to experience 400 *something* kph. Not *exactly* 400 kph. She would just think thats lame. But she wants that *Exact* car. I even imagine she is even gonna want to pick color! maybe a red or pearlescent orange


i mean... I think the outlandish behavour of jessica isnt directly caused by her actual mental problems... but I think they are... *connected*: because her eerie feeling episodes may allienate other people from her... leading her to develop a very exploratory, obcessive, adventurous and overall outcast attitude

They might ask her: "Garrll whats the color of your bugatee???" *joking* she might answer... in a playful, yet brash tone: "iTS FECKIN PINK!"

Wanna know something? I think Jessica's episode in an F1 car was a shame... because... she isnt fit for IMSA racing... dont you agree? She is a formula racing type of person. Like... she could have, at least, given indy car a go...

I think she was like: "I really, really, really, really wanna do this... but... Ahh forget it Im clearly out of my debt... Im no formula 1 driver..." *Self doubt*

"The brakes... It feels like an unrealistic videogame... that... you can actually drive... it feels like the developers of said game just said: "You press this button... you stop" And there is no weight in anything but the car just makes mushed fruit out of your brain if youre on soft tires! And its so weird to start up! I needed like 3 tries to start up the car..." *Looks back at it...* "But... No jessica... lets just leave... youre not built for this... Im not capable... come on say it with me Jessica: "Im not capable... Im not capable..."... I would die if I was in that thing... No I might even explode... Its... I cant do it... lets leave.." *Fighting the urge to step out her confort zone*

Also... jessica in particular has a very specific and recurring delusion: When she is having an episode, she frequently sees a "Red, white and black ball with playing card patterns on it". She never played with such a ball or reall ever seen such a ball or even touched or knew such a ball existed before the episodes... but it always comes back and when it does... it also comes with the belief she must protect the ball "at any cost." And she will see the ball just laying in the stranges of places - like balancing on the top of those wire fences on pit walls- and try to "retrieve it" by climbing. But it can also be on the floor (Lucky) but she can also see it like it is under the ground too (Like "wallhack"). If she manages to get to a place where she can (hopefully safely) pick the ball up, she will try to grab it... and grab it... and grab it... but her senses will not register any ball... so she then gets confused... and, when it is (hopefully on a not dangerous ground level place), she stays there for *Minutes* straight trying to grab it and hug it... then... it may stop... someone may pick her up...

But... even psychologists are afraid of actually giving her such a ball... as they have no idea what might happen

If you ask her about her V racing lines all serious she will just say like: "ATAO! MULHER COM XARECA SO CORRE EM Vês pa! N podia ser doutra forma bro!"

Rubbin’ is racin’.

You just know that if she race in F1 she JUST HAS to race for HAAS... There is NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE!

Shes like a refined version of a Forza player (she doesnt wallride... not because its "ugly". She doesnt do it because its slower. She doesnt punt due to similar reasoning. "I mean... cars are built to last 2 hours right? if they dont account for a little rough action they are just coping too much" *She said in the radio after getting a 1 minute penalty added to the overall team race time at the end of an event in the nurburgring GP circuit for overtaking half the grid through bump-n-running in Turn 1, doing it once every lap she can because, in her mind, "its a freebie overtake. They should just expect it. Im just racing over here" and "Dale Earnardht Did it... is he better than me because hes a man? Is that what  you are implying?" *Low-Key Gaslighting**). (Smh the girl should take some kind of pill bro the race was suposed to be 2 hours like... my god)

The fact that her personality doesnt even  imply any diagnoses or conditions... like... is she a jerk? is she narcissistic? Like... what is she? Theres not even anything you can even say! Like... bruh! Smh...

She has peak "Just a girl online" energy.
She can be either...
"What? Am I too much? What if I was the love of your life, huh? How about that? Do you really wanna miss out?"
Or...
"What? Do you really like me? Am I endearing? It's a disorder by the way... I have a PD bro"

(I can tell you right now why she has braces and glasses: She has braces because she gritted her teeth impulsively growing up and she has glasses because she played too many videogames also as a kid)

The perfect mix of a girlboss, an neet sleeper-built-confidence internet troll and a troublemaker

"gaslightling? I call it... negotiating with their boundaries"

Shes "Jessica, the NEET, Trollboss racer"


"You know why I race? And why I race like I do? Because I live for action. For the level crossing between madness and brilliance. To prove points and to contest stupidity and injustice. I go to war in the racetrack, not to take care of business, but to show certain people we are not and never were even, regardless if they knew it beforehand. When you are in my position, you cannot afford to run away from your problems. You must face them. From anything I could possibly have... I just wish I had a stronger mind. I wish I could just bottle everything up... not depend on anyone else... I wish people did not have to deal with me. Because I dont race for show. I race... to show the world the gaping gashes my ill mind and my short fuse left on my body and my soul... to prove them they can overcome it too... because I also came from nothing. I came from petty, dark places. From unecessary skirmishes and squabbling... I endured AND caused futility by myself... and came out... brighter. I wish I could just run away from my problems, though... and not have to be a burden anymore"
