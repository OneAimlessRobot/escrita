*So Jessica is currently racing at Sebring, but not her in the car this time around, but her teamate, Alvaro Parente, who moved from Mclaren this season. he is driving consistently and the telemetry and monitorized body vitals are also good so the Radio operator decides to revise details of the strategy in case he missed something, so he can tell them. Thoughtful yet shy type of guy, introspective and reserved... Reflective but a bit submissive. Noteable earnestness. He finds jessica, on her break, currently looking at *more* pictures of alonso on her fake-smartphone. (Its so scrappy that it uses Opera Mini as the browser and was bought by her mum for 40 euros in 2007. Its... 2021). She is quite immersed and does not like to get disturbed. But she is quite perceptive so the operator sometimes likes to trust her to acess track-specific details he and the other staff might have missed during her stint. But... what his earnest and innocent mind did not know was that... he was actually poking a hornets nest*

Him: Hey, Jessica? *He stands right in front of her as he says this... pulling her out of her world*

J. Mata #51: *Startled... tries to remain composed but her face says it all... pale as ice and sweaty like embarassment... shivers a bit upon being interrupted. But her tone is tepid, composed and solid like a good O' leather boot* "Yes?"

Him: "is there something I missed? areas with low grip for him to watch for... did you have to break hard for the wide, uphill bend before the kemmel straight? Did the car bottom out? If so, where?"

J. Mata #51: *Sighs... keeps browsing images... not even looking up from her fake phone* "Go away."

Him: *Suddently... genuenly feels like he should go away... but Terry Johnson told you that if you were assertive and direct with her she would give you a chance...* *Starts feeling like she is asking some kind of crush out and this time he is a hairs thickness of distance from leaving the interaction... but perserveers* "Look... Im... Im just asking a question can... can you look at me for a second? Just wanna confirm something"

J. Mata #51: *interpreting the whole interaction as an attack for no reason* "Look, nerd. I know what I am doing. You dont need to come here to criticize me... Im just doing my job okay?"

Him: "Th- thats not the po-"

J. Mata #51: *Smells blood... so strikes* "No No No... listen okay? Listen to me."

Him: "No Wa-"

J. Mata #51: "No No you listen. I spoke first ok?" *She did not... and why does that matter? Ugh such a difficult person*

Him: *yields...* "O- Okay..."

J. Mata #51: *Strawmans the whole conversation* "You sit there... on that porch over there like some kind of pimp while I wrestle with a literal 1.5 ton monster out there on the track ok? You dont have the right to be like this... I work my ASS OFF! What do you do? Give me some pro-tips?"

Him: *Clueless to why the conversation is here... or why it even started* "O- Okay then... nevermind..." *Trails off... hesitantly towards his spot again... like he did not even need anything in the first place* *Sigh...*
