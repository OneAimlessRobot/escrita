*So jessica is at a hypermarket store right? She is waiting for her turn in line and some old lady cuts her off because there is a rule in that specific store where old people have priority if there arent in front of them. (The line was quite long and Jessica, being as impatient and logical as she is, was beginning to get morbidly frustrated with waiting. She had been there for an hour already.) Jessica doesnt know this and revolts*

"Hey! Back! Go back! Shooo! Shooo!"
*Jessica says in a condescending and demeaning tone...*
*The old lady is offended after essentially being "Shooed" away for doing something allowed*
"Hey you little- I can skip the line! See? *Points walking stick to a sign that says: "Elders first!"*. I have priority!"

*jessica was having a less-than-ideal day... so, seeing as this is "just an old lady", she doubles down*

"Well... why dont I have priority? If I had a broken leg or my cousin was in the hospital could I not overtake?"

"The sign doesnt mention anything about dying cousins so, when in doubt, as you ought to have been taught you little gremlin, you STAY. In. The. LINE!"

*Jessica heard this to the end but she was not having it*

"look you wrikly hunch back, quasimodo knock off, I am an adult woman and I still have a job okay? I dont have all day to wait for the deceased to head to their graves! And besides... Just because Im young it doesnt mean I should wait infinitely for decaying 'desmamadas' (breastless) like you to pass! What if there were like 15 of you?"

"You would still pass because thats the rul-"

"Youre not BETTER THAN ME UNDERSTAND? whethere youre taller, it doesnt matter. Youre not smarter or better because your older! Its all about perspective. Taller people see different stuff so they are valuable. Short people see different stuff so they also have novel and wise stuff to share! Same thing with age. You just live longer. Youre not better than me! I am NOT letting you through. Go back! Shooo! Understand?!"

*The manager was outside for a phone call... so the old lady yields and... goes back in line... from where she came from*

*Damn girl... its just one woman! How hurt are you damn... I think I can sorta see why she wasnt popular until she started racing now lmao*
