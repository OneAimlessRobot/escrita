Freak thing

Get Lost!

Hey! Look at me! Hey! Look here you suckers!

Fear pisses me off

If you are pure and honest, you will become a freak

I came while making this.



cum, sadness and clarity

Trees n nodes n shit

I am the fucking main character.

Shooting, goals and nutmegs

hypercumvore

cum is a drink served at body temperature

coders are losers. Programmers make bangers

I watched my neighbhours flock of sheep feast on my dead rabbit.

I am the Sun melter

birthday bukcake

teenagehood at 20

I walked on top of the sun and survived



Type: Musical Track
Genre: Rock for emo shitheaded types like myself.
Title: Kichi - Melting the sun (voice cracked cover)
Desc: Listen up, you raw pieces of biological disgustness! Get on top of this trash stadium and sing! Ive seen and lived it all so I know a thing or two about myself and the world! I sang, cried, mourned, lifted, came, thought and said spiteful things to sweet people. Ive once ran so mutch I fell off and fainted! But there were still people who helped me! People by my side and people with me on their minds! Get on my level, because we will melt it! We will shoot ourselves into the sky and outshine every city and every party! The entire planet shall hear us scream in agony and euphoria! Get your parents, your cat, your boyfriend! Girlfriend! Both! Your best friends and your worst enemies! Call them right now if they are still stalking you! You know they are! Us arrogant meatbags shall shake it until we collapse in cramps and our muscles tear like weak rubber bands! We shall collapse and explode! And everyone outside will be confused as fuck but we wont care! Because here we leave our regrets at the entrance and our worst fears in our minds! They shall live in our heads forever... to remind us.. that... in the end... we are all worthlessly weak.
