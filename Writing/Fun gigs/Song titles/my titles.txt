Song titles for my life


If you hate me just because I like dumdum girls you can shove it.

Videogames make me feel alone...
so alone...

Loneliness is sad. Loneliness is magical. Loneliness is where it all truly begins.

Launching connections through the TFP

True Friendship Protocol.

Critical Damage Sustained. Activating to Lonely mode. Goodnight.

Gravity Defying.

Honey, Will you play Counter Strike with me?

Making videogame mods to heal

Do I make it an admin command or a client command



The more something is itself, the more powerful it becomes

I yeeted my 1 legged uncle cleetus into a concrete wall and he fainted


A heateater cannot be tamed. Every ending is a new beginning. Please allow me to invite you to leave. Some memories are best forgotten. Now Im gonna erase. Everything Ive done for you. Everything Ive done to you. All the dreams we have ever shared. All is crumbling too dust.

Planes in the sky bring me back to the earth.
