Name: The spider.
Type: (Very scary!!!!!!!!!!) aracnid
Dimensions: 0.2m radius
Build: Very furry, thick legs. Thick, furry frame. Thick and VERY SCARY! voice. It likes to sneak around people's houses to scare them for absolutely no reason. its identity does not really go much beyond that, though... It feels lost if people do not react to its taunts and mindgames. Featurs 6 red eyes.  It is rather slow... but still too fast for its size if you ask me. I think even zero speed is too fast for its size. it is poisonous, but it only causes unberable itching in humans and wears out after a comple hours. Its bite hurts alot, though it isnt strong enough to draw blood or sever even our outer skins. But its voice is very intense and it *loves* to talk while under pitch darkness way too much. It does not know how to build webs. In the wild, it hides in bushes and hunts anything from big wasps from small mice and even others of its kind and other species of spiders. it is a huge softie, though.

Quotes: 
*Eerie, horror-movie-shock-value chord of some air instrument, joined by comically slow fade-out of darkness. it appears in a top corner of your room. its looking at you. it cannot speak proper english*

MUAHAHAHAAHAHH! I AM the SPIDER!

*it expects you to scream. if you do, it says:*

"MUAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHGAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!111!!11!!!!"

*And then crawls on top of your body and hops its way out of the house, crawling fast across the whole appartment/House and into the streets/woods, laughing the whole way there. Then... just rinse and repeat for the next house. besides hunting and seeking shelter by burying on the soil, it does not... really do much...*

*But if you dont scream... it... it vents*

"MY LIFE DOES NOT MAKE SENSE! IM JUST A STUPID, UGLY SPIDER THAT WASTES ITS TIME!!!! IM A USELESS SPIDER! USELESS! USELESS! USELESS!!!! WAAHHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!"
