Owned by many college students throughout years of being kept at room 150 of a college student residence, the last room of north side of the first floor, this fridge is an appliance of many stories and lots of wisdom. Its also... how should I put this... side-track-able.

*While Nina, the social studies ugrad female student, is prepping for her political science test*
"Wow! Mrs Nina! What is that poster! You cant put posters on the walls! Thats against the rules!"
She replies: "Shut it! I need to focus, dumbass!" "Fine! But then Ill tell the cleaning ladies..." "Tell who? They dont even come here..." "Yes they do. They just dont warn you... its your first year right?" "THEY do WHAT?"

*Watching a live stream of a CSGO Match with a male student named Cristiano, the data science undergrad*

"Cristiano! Look! The Ts are going mid! But the CTs... the CTs know! Look! A fly on your screen! Swat it its covering the crosshair! Look! A flash! Turn away! Turn away!" He replies: "Calm down! Im not the one playing the game!" "But he just got flashed! NOW HE DIED!" "I have eyes! Calm down!"

*Gets off trolling people by suddently stopping the compressor... making students have to stop what they are doing to check if its plugged or not. Its not. It does this almost every half an hour.*

*Watching a nerd watch a video about fridges*

Video: "These fridges are amazing devices! Simple, compact, portable and , with the essential moving door, no moving parts at all! It features a compressor, some Isobutane, in the case of this specific model, some tubes and wires! A hobbyist could make one with enough resources. But whats more striking is how, despite its diminuted build, the isolation it provides is often more than sufficient! It demonstrates just how refined and optimized refrigerator technology has become since the first time it was patented. And, due to the advent of the invention of Isobutane, unless you are some crazy weirdo that buys them in bulk and purposefully makes it leak gas, the emissions are just not a problem! They need maintenance from experienced people, but thats about it! One of the most beautiful concepts ever materialised! The refrigeration cycle... in a both useful and endearing package!"

Garry: "Hehehe..." *blushing... waits a couple seconds... realises its blushing will make the food go tepid* "Ahh! Stop stop stop! stop thinking good things! Stop!" *blushes even more*


Rated at 230V
Storage capacity of 35 cans of Buddwiser.
Mini cube fridge
Black color. Not a brooder though. Came from the factory.
Wishes it was white, so It could show people its yellowed isolation rubber... as a sign of its wisdomn and age. 
Its been in service at the residence for 10 semesters, through winter breaks and summer grinds...
One day... allegedly... a pizza disappeared from inside of it at 4am in the summer.
People havent found the culprit yet... 
The student at the time began hypnotherapy to figure out if they sleep walked.
*Hehe.xd*

Basically a standard cube fridge version of ditzy from the Beyblade original series

"Im Garry. Im a 5 year old fridge manufactured in 2019. I spend my days... *sigh...* chilling... (damn that does not feel funny right now) brooding over nothing, and mulling and whinning... Oh! And teasing! and trolling. My existence... feels empty. Im empty. I conserve... soft drinks, 1 to 2 dishes of take away food a day... or even....organs. Im a pretty *chuckles* cool guy though. I crack jokes, I sit... I am carried and I get to snitch on people. People usually hate me. But we dont mind eachother. I have no arms and no legs, so, I wish I could move. But not in a carnival ride. That would be pointless and empty. I wish I had nerves, a heart and a soul. Nerves that move muscles. Muscles that suck oxygen. But all I have... is mysterious innards that just allow me... to... be. To experience, think and, because of that, to exist. Because everything that thinks exists. Anyways... I may feel empty, yes. But... Although I would prefer to, even if only once in my life, take a single step over 1 thousand carnival rides, I ve learned that I should be proud... simply because I am. Just being is a reason to be proud. If you feel, powerless dont. Because you can still feel. I should have that as just something I can look forward to and yearn... even if its impossible. Sometimes... its better to just... be and yearn, than obcessively try to bring the absurd into existence."
