Built normally, although somewhat chubby.
Desc: Energetic, curious and logical to a fault. Her appetite for knowledge and indulgence on science traps her in an inpenetrable and cold wall that protects her from the worl cruelty. No trauma involved, she is just made like that.  Warm, but hard to approach at the same time. "Hello! you look nice today, Mafalda!" "What did I do to look nice? Are my looks the adequate ones? Should I try to work on anything?" Her curiosity knows no bounds. Shes like a japanese Scientist. At first, her peers allways hate her. Allways with the better grades, always with the insightful comments. But when the tough moments come... She is fervent, but detached. Her innocence pours ou of her eyes and face. Everyone suddently starts cheering. The cynnics take some time but they all eventually fall for her childlike charm. Is a soccer manager at a local club. There, she puts all her energy into the beautiful and poetic puzzle that is HighSchool Football. She stays awake all night thinking about strategies. She manged to start inventing some unconventional ones. But that is due to the sheer ammount of research she does, as she is not the type to typically think outside the box. She gets this twisted, but playful grin when she comes up with something. Her brand of football is one giant experiment, although too focused on the collective, which frustrated some of the more flashy players.
