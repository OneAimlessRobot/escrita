Build: 
Gatling gun of medicine. 
It takes ammo with size similar to an ipobrufen pill from a generic blister box of ben-u-ron. 
It shoots at 300 rpm
And each shot has a kinetic energy of 100J
It is belt fed.
A belt inside a big drum can carry up to 1000 pills.
Very, very precise... as pills have almost no recoil. But not very accurate in windy conditions, as the pills can get flung by even the smallest gusts of air, which happens because they cannot be shot very hard, otherwise they break.

Weapon on-hit effect:

The effects are not really tied to the weapon itself, but more to the pills used as ammo. But... here is a catch. If someone gets hit by the Pill Gatling and gets an effect, even if the effect hasnt worn out yet, on the following hit, the effect of the current pill will get completly reset and the person will revert back to normal during that instant, getting the effect of the new pill instead.

Works like the XM8 From Metal Gear Ac!d
