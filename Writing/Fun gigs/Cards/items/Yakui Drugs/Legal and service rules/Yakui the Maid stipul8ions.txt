Yakui the Maid... in a quest to make her chemically packaged moods and feelings reach people in a legitimate way... knowing she, self procramingly, "is only good at chemistry", And taking advantage of her degree and license as a chemist, She invented a profession! She Invents drugs to share with people, making contracts about each one before going on a journey to share them. The contract includes a generic header template and then a full description of the effects of the drug.... as written by a friend of hers who makes them, including technical details like side effects physiological effects and side effects. She is beginning by going from door to door asking people to try them, to gain traction, trust and legitimacy from people. And... now she can also monetise her efforts and passion! These are her stipulations


People have to say yes;
They can change their minds after they pay, and they can choose to go to a waiting list to think it through;
"I test them on ME first! ok? ME!"
"I want to make people feel moods and emotions. Experience the raw power of direct, chemically induced sensations and moods."
"The police said yes, I spoke with loads of lawyers and I have to confirm it with legal doctors before even designing a product. So yes. IT IS legit. Ok?"
"I already have a chemistry degree so I could have a job at a lab. I stayed there for 6 years. I hated it. So now I do this!"
