People have to say yes;
They can change their minds after they pay, and they can choose to go to a waiting list to think it through;
"I test them on ME first! ok? ME!"
"I want to make people feel moods and emotions. Experience the raw power of direct, chemically induced sensations and moods."
"The police said yes, I spoke with loads of lawyers and I have to confirm it with legal doctors before even designing a product. So yes. IT IS legit. Ok?"
"I already have a chemistry degree so I could have a job at a lab. I stayed there for 6 years. I hated it. So now I do this!"
