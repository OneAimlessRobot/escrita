Yakui analysis


Bro. i just wish there was a device that fuckin... idk... enabled you to take a very, very deep vibe inside your soul and just make people experience it directly. Like chemically, even. Thats why I do art. So I can, at least, get close to that


Maybe thats why... Yakui the Maid (character) loves drugs so much? Maybe thats why she is a drug addict that self crafts medicine
And shares it with others?
Maybe she is lonely... and thats how she connects. Using pure, raw, chemistry. The elusive image she is after is one of connecting with other fellow Men... by experimenting with chemical arts and crafts. Experimenting with reagents, ways of administration, sensations, side effects. First... on herself. And then on others. By convincing them to try them, literally feel the precise chemicals she senses within. She crafts pharmaceutical art. Writing? Too difficult. Music? Too ethereal? Chemicals are raw. Physiological. Raw. Biological. Celular. Metabolic manifestations of her inner world. Images, words and feelings are all fake. Human consciousness... is made of molecules. Blood. Hormones. And transdermic patches.


All her life... always alone. Never really seen beyond her odd appearance. Not judged... but also not noticed. Never felt the touch of a man in the way crave the touch of their prefered gender so much... crafting chemical vibes. Always having to prove herself constantly and never allowed to shine. Stuck in her lab... testing brutal concotions on herself until... it just clicks. All the videogames, all her childhood memories. She feeds herself that way. Memories. Because... in the present, she is stagnant. Always the same lab, always the same clothes, the same old hobby of chemistry. She may have found a new niche... but people dont give a damn. Shes just an overqualified street artist. At least... thats how she feels. That direct, visceral, chemical connection... beyond mere words or touch... is all she craves.
The drugs... the glass... the pills. Its her poetry. The syringes, the blisters... the stands... her distilation setup... its her citadel. Her home. She has scars... from her masterpiece. 4 very ugly ones... from desperate attempts at making her CBM-2007-2.5. Chlorine of Bring Me 2007. 2.5mL. A drug that was projected to make people feel nostalgic. Like games. Source games. Old famiclone Nintendo games. Old house. Old friends. Old memories. She is indifferent towards competition... prejudice... stability. She lacks an identity. Values. Who cares about the top job at a Lab when you cannot decide what to do with your life... without other people to comfort you. Loneliness... Her scars were attempts at making an injectible. The chlorine reacts with the blood vessel walls... literally roasting them... from the inside out. She damaged some nerves... getting ocasional spasms. All so that she can give her nostalgia away. "I am not a Woman. I am not a Person. I am not 38 years old. I am an emotion radio station. And I am immortal. I will turn every single emotion into drugs. Everybody will experience them. And then....only then... my life will be complete. After that, I will die. And I will return to the earth." Getting her degree as a chemist 6 years. Bachelor, Masters, Doctorate. PhD. Then... She got her job, and experimented on herself on the side. Just so people would trust her.


Thats the story, of Yakui the Maid.
