Desc: Yakui the maid often creates music with very melancholic themes or (logical or) energy or (logical or) melodies. Heat, end of school, boredom, slowness, dryness, droughts among other things are sometimes associated with Summer. Heat. Sun. Helios. The feeling of being so tired and sluggish that all you can do is walk while looking down and all you can focus on are the small tarmac pebbles on the road/sidewalk, really hard, scorching hot, peppered with equally hard and hot loose pebbles... the slightest trip and hit on the ground will scrape your limbs, everything seems so far, you hear nothing on your head. You are sweaty, you are unmmotivated. You can barely open your eyes. Hot. Sun.Helios
By 6:45am, an ominous object appears and it lights up a line in the sky. Its a big blob of electric gas. Its the closest thing to a thermonuclear landscape we have near. Its core temperature is in the 7digits. All praise the unforgiving god of the sun, who has risen from slumber once again. He watches. His energy overwhelming energy raining on us relentlessly, cooking us alive mercilessly.
