Status effect: When worn in one user's  left ear and anothers right ear and both are within 30 meters of eachother, both will fuse together. Both parties' personality vectors will add up and then get normalised to length 1. For example: if someone with an ENTP ego and another person with an INTJ ego fuse together, they will basically complete ego integration in one fell swoop. They will basically become perfectly balanced. Yet if they are young and both reckless in their own ways, for example, that will still persist. But whatever traits complement eachother will become perfectly matured. if two ENTPs fuse, they will become MORE ENTP. You get it. Both users' experiences will coexist but, with a new active memory, it will be like both just became siamese twins. Both their psyche paths will converge. And analogous things happen with their physical strength, cognitive talents, generational habits, musical taste, etc.
If the fused person goes to sleep, when it wakes up they will unfuse! And because I dont wanna give much thought, once again, lets just say they can spam it. Oh! There is a catch I came up with right this second: It has to be a FULL sleep cycle.
