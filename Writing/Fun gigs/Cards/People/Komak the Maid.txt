A maid with an attire similar to yakuis, but reaches the ankles.
Has amber eyes, blue long hair.
Smokes on the job. Has bionic right arm. Before, she could not even hold a glass of water properly. but now, after years and years of gradual tweaking, accidents, awkwardness, innadequacy and... slapping people in the face accidentally, she can play snooker... well! Mentor for yakui the maid. Stands at 180cm and weighs 79 kg.

She is rather blunt, can come across as dismissive. Her words may be profound, although she expresses herself through words way more. She is a female Maid.
She has black underliner in the eyes. Shows. Does not tell. Naturally comes up with profound sayings involving concepts about death, decay, emotion and philosophy. Prefers to engage with people on her own terms. Very awkward when forced into social situations she does not expect. "They should all die. I am still metamorphising. Let me ressuscitate!" (Wait! Give me time to engage my social gears!)

Komak is known in the WST as the 3S Maid (Sub Second Shot)

Her V/D ratio against Ronnie O Sullivan is 2 to 8 

Frustrated because she almost always wins against Murphy, but cannot overtake him because he wins more overall games

Franz Kafka fan. Motorsports fan. Owns a Subaru Impreza. Likes to take it rallying with Yakui. The subaru is always repainted with the same specific color with which it came from factory

Komak has alexithymia. She may have incredible ammounts of sheltered anger against something, and even speak in a tone that makes it evident, which intimidates people due to her overall demeanour and deep, strong voice, but when asked about it, simply answer: "Well... I guess... Idk... anyways I have to get something done. If you want anything........... CALL ME, UNDERSTAND?!". She tries Yakuis drugs so she can understand emotions.
