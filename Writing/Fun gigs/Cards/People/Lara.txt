Natural red lips and an attractive voice. Her cheeks are like apples: full of color and definition. Her legs are long. Her Thighs close together in two curves. Her fit: Always seen wearing loose  and long dresses and stockings, black air force sneakers, punk-like ripped, flourescent color loose sleeves, a tennis bandana, black eyeliner. She has piercings on both her calves. Her look always looks dazed and drooling. 
Desc: This girl is... interesting. Her demeanour is a slow and contemplative one... for example always approaching problems strongly prefering to guess with innocence than conclude with certainty. She has a slowness to her movements that is almost hypnotic and dances on the hallways. Has (undiagnosed) ADID (Innatentive ADD). Always seen with a finger up her lips, she butts in in conversations asking stuff like: "Why do I sometimes have to go to the bathroom but then have to do it like 40 seconds later?" "Why do people not just ask google everything? Why go to school?"
"Why do people get attracted to eachother? Why do gays exist? Why isnt everyone gay? Why isnt everyone straight?" "Can you help me with my homework? I dont know If I should use a red pen or *this* black one instead... and its due tomorrow!" ... in the middle of the main plaza of the city/village she resides at at the time. She never quite knows what she wants and has a hard time caring about whats happening immediatly around her. Her diet is always the same: A bird meat stake, canned peas, supermarket soup and a banana. Yes. Includes breakfast. In the holidays, takes showers at 5 am, goes to sleep at 1 PM and wakes up at 9 pm. She hates anything directly related to school. Tried and hated academic rituals, like being a student council member in highschool. (The wooden hallway lockers were catching fire and she was responsible of guiding everyone to safety. But quickly found out she gets... not overwhelmed... but drained from urgent situations. When she got out the school premises, she layed down on the concrete floor and... began to... actually snooze *on a local road*. (Ok she was on a sidewalk but still). One driver passed by and thought she was dead! Her peers laugh at her for "being a dumb blonde". Uses reddit as a text editor for notes. People also call her dumb there. Over time, the "Dumb blonde" comments started getting to her. "But... mom? What is... discipline?" "But mom? Why do I have to work? Im not good at anything important..." "Mom... can I die now? Can I... Like... just disappear? Im not useful... I can get cute guys to giggle... but thats it..." Her mom replies with things like: "I dont know... DaUgHtEr! Why did God Himself have to make me waste my time with a passarelle doll spoiled princess?" Her moms voice appears during school tests. In almost all of them, she only writes her name... misspelled... leaves... and goes sit at the entrance listening to synth rock/bossa nova mixes. She is flaky with friends and romantic partners, very air headed, her logic focuses more on flair and expression than outcomes, her dressing is flashy and she does not remember most things about other people, so she was diagnosed with HPD. In her last ever highschool test, She did not even write her name: She wrote: "Ill miss you all... Mr. Professor(She calls every teacher Mr Professor because she does not remember their names with enough consistency to ditch this tendency) and a blurred mark. It was a tear. From that old, fated math test day on, she was not seen by anyone of that particular school... anywhere... ever again. "I am Lara. And when I get big, I wanna be a red swallow!"


The story of how Lara got her look:

Ok... Lara's roundy face and wide , blue eyes are from birth, alongside her
blonde hair and satin strands. But... also at birth, her nose had a weird shape. At 5 years old, while her big brother was listening to rock music from the MTV television channel. She was enjoying it so much she began running all over the house and screaming and violently shaking her little head around. She jumped on beds, couches, etc. But Then... she jumped off her mothers bed and fell face first into the floor... beginning to cry and also breaking her nose. So... she had to get surgery. But the doctors were on mad scientist timing. So... they thought: "such a beautiful little girl... but what a weird nose!" So they fixed Lara's nose, but also decided to remove excess material... to make it prettier.

Then... in middle school, She enjoyed sports alot, playing every single one at least once. But... she particularly liked tennis. She enjoyed the intimate connection she would feel with her opponents while playing, meeting her best friend through playing it. But... she simply could not beat her. So... in her frustration, Lara trained alot in her free time... with the help of youtube, that was starting to grow at the time, her older brother and her mother. So... after about 10 months of training ending 6 days shy from a local summer break under 13 tennis tournament, she decided to enter. She advanced all the way to the semis, meeting her best friend in the court. After an intense game, where she played relentlessly and was toe to toe with her opponent, she unfortunately lost. So... to consolate herself, Lara asked her friend for her bandana, to remember that day, that she enjoyed alot despite the loss. Thats the story of the sports bandana. But she eventually replaced it and began to always wearil one as a part of her usual fit. Also... thats when she decided she loved to wear cheap sneakers, because, she believed that shoes were suposed to be "disposable like erasers"

Then... in later middle school, where lots of her classmates were entering their angsty, melancholic phases, she noticed they started dressing up quite differently than what she was used to. Black clothes, stockings, chains... she did not really understand why so she joined them! Her mother bought her stockings and some ripped detached sleeves with flourescent coloring, like Lara wanted.

And then... her dress... she got it as a 16 year old birthday gift in july,  the month of her birthday. She liked it because it was flowing and comfortable. And because it was red.

And... at 17, she decided to just put two piercings in her calves because "why not?"
