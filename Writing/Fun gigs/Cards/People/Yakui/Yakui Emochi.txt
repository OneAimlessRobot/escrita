Yakui

￼

Biographical information

Date of birth

October 11

Physical description

Species

Human

Gender

Female

Yakui is one of the most popular maids. Her name comes from "Yakuji" ("Medicine"), also comes from “Yaku”（“calamity”）.

Appearance

Yakui has bob-cut purple hair, and her maid outfit is usually blue, or purple. She is usually drooling in art, or has a crazed look in her eye. She is sometimes shown wearing handcuffs. The pills she takes stunted her growth, leading to her being quite short.

Personality

Yakui is addicted to pharmaceuticals. She's known to give out medicinal advice to passersby in drug stores, but whether this advice is good or not is up for speculation. At critical moments, she can see what is invisible to others and hear what others can't hear. She's very capable without her medication, but a slight overdose would make her useless. The handcuffs are meant to force her to cut down on her medication every month to behave. She can simultaneously hallucinate others, and keep herself in a trance for long periods of time, which is dangerous. However，when it comes to changing people's hearts with medication, she always draws the line and guards it.

Yakui guns


Name: Pill Gatling
Type: Weapon
Type of weapon: Projectile repeater weapon.
Type of repeater: Multi spinning-barrel machine gun.
Type of projectile: Non explosive pills.
Projectile repeating action: Gas operation.
Build: 
Gatling gun of medicine. 
It takes ammo with size similar to an ipobrufen pill from a generic blister box of ben-u-ron. 
It shoots at 300 rpm
And each shot has a kinetic energy of 100J
It is belt fed.
A belt inside a big drum can carry up to 1000 pills.
Very, very precise... as pills have almost no recoil. But not very accurate in windy conditions, as the pills can get flung by even the smallest gusts of air, which happens because they cannot be shot very hard, otherwise they break.

Weapon on-hit effect:

The effects are not really tied to the weapon itself, but more to the pills used as ammo. But... here is a catch. If someone gets hit by the Pill Gatling and gets an effect, even if the effect hasnt worn out yet, on the following hit, the effect of the current pill will get completly reset and the person will revert back to normal during that instant, getting the effect of the new pill instead.

Works like the XM8 From Metal Gear Ac!d

Owned by Yakui the Maid


Name: Syringe Mortar Launcher
Type: Weapon
Type of weapon: Artilery.
Type of rifle: Recoilless artilery.
Type of projectile: Explosive primmed syringe grenades w/ chemical payload. (Drug Artilery)
Explosive: A small bit of gun powder
Primer: Syringe needle
Projectile chemical payload: Syringe contents
Action:
Single shot.



Build: 
Shoulder carried syringe mortar launcher. 
Syringes are big, vintage syringes only partially metalic shelled, to allow the gunner to see dose.
(The needle breaking triggers the gunpowder, which blows up, desintegrating the syringe and spreading the chemical payload)
Manual reloading so low cadence.
Precision depends on the wind and the users skill.
The projectiles are sent off by the mortar with an exit velocity of a MLB pitch


Projectile on-contact effect:

On contact:
Non-Organic entities: Needle breaks.

Organic entities: They get pierced but Tip does not break, so contents get injected

On detonation:
The effects of its contents are spread across a spherical area of radius 5m.

Yakui Laws:

People have to say yes;
They can change their minds after they pay, and they can choose to go to a waiting list to think it through;
"I test them on ME first! ok? ME!"
"I want to make people feel moods and emotions. Experience the raw power of direct, chemically induced sensations and moods."
"The police said yes, I spoke with loads of lawyers and I have to confirm it with legal doctors before even designing a product. So yes. IT IS legit. Ok?"
"I already have a chemistry degree so I could have a job at a lab. I stayed there for 6 years. I hated it. So now I do this!"

Yakui backstory


Bro. i just wish there was a device that fuckin... idk... enabled you to take a very, very deep vibe inside your soul and just make people experience it directly. Like chemically, even. Thats why I do art. So I can, at least, get close to that


Maybe thats why... Yakui the Maid (character) loves drugs so much? Maybe thats why she is a drug addict that self crafts medicine
And shares it with others?
Maybe she is lonely... and thats how she connects. Using pure, raw, chemistry. The elusive image she is after is one of connecting with other fellow Men... by experimenting with chemical arts and crafts. Experimenting with reagents, ways of administration, sensations, side effects. First... on herself. And then on others. By convincing them to try them, literally feel the precise chemicals she senses within. She crafts pharmaceutical art. Writing? Too difficult. Music? Too ethereal? Chemicals are raw. Physiological. Raw. Biological. Celular. Metabolic manifestations of her inner world. Images, words and feelings are all fake. Human consciousness... is made of molecules. Blood. Hormones. And transdermic patches.


All her life... always alone. Never really seen beyond her odd appearance. Not judged... but also not noticed. Never felt the touch of a man in the way crave the touch of their prefered gender so much... crafting chemical vibes. Always having to prove herself constantly and never allowed to shine. Stuck in her lab... testing brutal concotions on herself until... it just clicks. All the videogames, all her childhood memories. She feeds herself that way. Memories. Because... in the present, she is stagnant. Always the same lab, always the same clothes, the same old hobby of chemistry. She may have found a new niche... but people dont give a damn. Shes just an overqualified street artist. At least... thats how she feels. That direct, visceral, chemical connection... beyond mere words or touch... is all she craves.
The drugs... the glass... the pills. Its her poetry. The syringes, the blisters... the stands... her distilation setup... its her citadel. Her home. She has scars... from her masterpiece. 4 very ugly ones... from desperate attempts at making her CBM-2007-2.5. Chlorine of Bring Me 2007. 2.5mL. A drug that was projected to make people feel nostalgic. Like games. Source games. Old famiclone Nintendo games. Old house. Old friends. Old memories. She is indifferent towards competition... prejudice... stability. She lacks an identity. Values. Who cares about the top job at a Lab when you cannot decide what to do with your life... without other people to comfort you. Loneliness... Her scars were attempts at making an injectible. The chlorine reacts with the blood vessel walls... literally roasting them... from the inside out. She damaged some nerves... getting ocasional spasms. All so that she can give her nostalgia away. "I am not a Woman. I am not a Person. I am not 38 years old. I am an emotion radio station. And I am immortal. I will turn every single emotion into drugs. Everybody will experience them. And then....only then... my life will be complete. After that, I will die. And I will return to the earth." Getting her degree as a chemist 6 years. Bachelor, Masters, Doctorate. PhD. Then... She got her job, and experimented on herself on the side. Just so people would trust her.

"A girl came up to me... from a group with some folk. She walked close... flustered. She kept saying: "It is a dare. Dont. I have to retuen. Bye." I waa sitting alone in a table. Just me... and a glass of vodka... staring into its soul... wondering if there is ever interuptions to suffering... or if suffering is just loneliness. Or even... if connection itself is just seaaoning. Or even... The only seasoning. Wondering what kind of concotion I will try next... An ethanol enzhyme? A vasodilator that also relaxea the body? Another big batch of oxytocin injections? And if... that even matters... if people done even ask you your name, let alone who you are. Do people... even want... my drugs? Do people even want... my art? But I woke up from the depths... glanced over to her slightly... while still hunched over this measly cup of wallnut alchol... and just said: " 'm fine..." "


Thats the backstory of Yakui the Maid.

"No, you brick case! I test my drugs becau- Ok ever programmed before? Or built any kind of machine....cooked a dish? You need to test them right? Sometimes I get addicted but I need to do it!"

Someone: "What? What did you just eat? What was that pill? Isnt it illegal?"

Yakui the Maid
Omg... I hate explaining I hate explaining... Wait... let me finish my chromil then we talk ok? Looks back at it... its starting to bubble too much so I start ignoring you for a second... I decide to put some little pebbles inside the flask to quiet down the boiling a little. Then switch off the heating. Its ready... whatever I wanted this liquid for... well... now I have it... whatever... its cool I guess... 90 dollars from Sigma Aldritch... while eating like a peasent... as a veteran chem researcher... what am I doing... sigh...

Femboy roomate

Yakui the Maid

Femboy roomate
i look at the chromil and nod, a bit impressed by the work you did

“Y-yeah…”

i look back at you and take a deep breath before speaking “But anyways, I have some questions…”

Femboy roomate
“Why…why do you do all this stuff..?” i gesture to the chemicals and flasks around the room “I just want to know…”

Yakui the Maid
I like chemistry... thats all...

Femboy roomate
“…and that’s why you do all of…this?”

i gesture to the room again, looking at you with a bit of disbelief

Yakui the Maid
What? Its my chemicals... and its an individual room... thank god its an individual room... so I can do this

Femboy roomate
“I-i get that…but like, you do know all of this stuff is seriously dangerous and can kill people, right..?”

Femboy roomate
“So why are you just casually…brewing stuff like this? Isn’t that a bit reckless..?”

Yakui the Maid
I just hurt myself when testing... making is not the problem... ok? Dont worry... you wont get hurt okay?

Femboy roomate
“W-wait wait…why exactly do you hurt yourself?”

i raise a brow looking quite confused and worried

Yakui the Maid
I mean... there is only risk in hurting myself! because... I sometimes forget stuff just got out of the heater and I... burn my tongue! thats it!

Yakui quirks

Favourite TF2 class is the demoman.

Gushes over MVM.

Does not get along with conventional PVP.

MVM'ed her way up to getting an australium stock grenade launcher she name tagged as "PillGatling"
