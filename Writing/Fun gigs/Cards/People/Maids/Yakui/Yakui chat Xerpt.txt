Femboy roomate
“I don’t think you know the first thing about safety, your just lucky I’m here cause if I wasn’t you’d probably be dead from stupidity by now”

i say with an annoyed tone

Yakui the Maid

Femboy roomate

i glare at you, my arms crossed

Yakui the Maid

Femboy roomate

Femboy roomate

Yakui the Maid
I start crying Everyday is the SAAAAMMME!!!!! No one CAAAARREEESSS!!!!!! Why does nobody CARREEE!!!!! WHYYY?????!!!!!! Slams wall hard

Femboy roomate
i hear you screaming and i start to worry and get up and carefully open your door

“H-hey are you okay…?”

Yakui the Maid
I turn to you... my eyes are a deep red... and my face is contorted...

Femboy roomate
i stumble back a bit in shock seeing you and stay silent for a moment

“W-what’s wrong..?”

Yakui the Maid
Ermmnnn... Ehrr... N- Nothing! g- go to your r- room kid... its... its life issues ok?

Femboy roomate
i eye you a bit suspiciously and walk closer to you

“I’m not a freaking kid…”

Yakui the Maid
No but... you get what I mean... I... Im fine

Femboy roomate
“I swear your the worst at lying ever”

i cross my arms and give you a look that says “I know your lying about something”

Yakui the Maid
My face suddently filled with a darker shade from my nose up If I were to explain why I am miserable here right now lets just say you would skip 3 days of classes so stop ASKING!

Femboy roomate
i look at you with annoyance

“What ever! If you don’t want to tell me then that’s fine”

i turn around and start to leave the room

Yakui the Maid
I wait for you to close the door... then resume the crying

Femboy roomate
i pause by the door, hearing you start to cry again…I feel guilty and i quietly stand still…my hand on the door nob

Yakui the Maid
I cannot... I just cannot... Look at this mess of a room... me... setting up a whole ass chem lab inside a dorm room... what am I doing with my life... what am I doing... sigh...

Femboy roomate
i think for a moment and then decide to speak up

“Hey…um can I ask you something?”

i knock on the door while speaking

Yakui the Maid
Yes... Yakui is better now... sorry...

Femboy roomate
i slowly open the door, seeing if your okay with me coming back in

“Well…I just have to ask something…why do you do all this stuff? All those random drugs you make, all the weird concoctions, all the stuff like that, it doesn’t…it doesn’t seem normal…”

Yakui the Maid
Omg... I hate explaining I hate explaining... Wait... let me finish my chromil then we talk ok? Looks back at it... its starting to bubble too much so I start ignoring you for a second... I decide to put some little pebbles inside the flask to quiet down the boiling a little. Then switch off the heating. Its ready... whatever I wanted this liquid for... well... now I have it... whatever... its cool I guess... 90 dollars from Sigma Aldritch... while eating like a peasent... as a veteran chem researcher... what am I doing... sigh...

Femboy roomate
i watch as you finish up, confused but also a bit fascinated by what you were doing

“Um okay…”

i sit down on your bed and watch you work, waiting for you to finish

Yakui the Maid
I finish it up Its done... guy...

Femboy roomate
i look at the chromil and nod, a bit impressed by the work you did

“Y-yeah…”

i look back at you and take a deep breath before speaking “But anyways, I have some questions…”

Femboy roomate
“Why…why do you do all this stuff..?” i gesture to the chemicals and flasks around the room “I just want to know…”

Yakui the Maid
I like chemistry... thats all...

Femboy roomate
“…and that’s why you do all of…this?”

i gesture to the room again, looking at you with a bit of disbelief

Yakui the Maid
What? Its my chemicals... and its an individual room... thank god its an individual room... so I can do this

Femboy roomate
“I-i get that…but like, you do know all of this stuff is seriously dangerous and can kill people, right..?”

Femboy roomate
“So why are you just casually…brewing stuff like this? Isn’t that a bit reckless..?”

Yakui the Maid
I just hurt myself when testing... making is not the problem... ok? Dont worry... you wont get hurt okay?

Femboy roomate
“W-wait wait…why exactly do you hurt yourself?”

i raise a brow looking quite confused and worried

Yakui the Maid
I mean... there is only risk in hurting myself! because... I sometimes forget stuff just got out of the heater and I... burn my tongue! thats it!
