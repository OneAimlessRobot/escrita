Build: This Maid creature dresses up pretty conventionally: A light brown maid outfit with white trimming. A long apron that goes up to just above the knees and a skirt at that same level. Her clothing is reserved and does not expose that much skin. Although with loose and thin, fabric, the dress features wide sleeves and a brown skirt embroided at he edges. Her legs are covered with striped, black and white tighs and her feet enveloped by dark brown tap shoes. She has long, straight, black hair, big, wide, black eyes, a small nose and predominantly possesses  a distant and nonchalant look. She gets sick easly, as her immune system is gifted backwards. Her voice is very ragged, yet high and gentle. She struggles to speak. She has no acessories. Her skin is white and pale. She is constantly aching from her teeth. She cannot eat potato chips, as they will make her gums bleed profusely. 
Vibe: A maid... pulled up. She looked... down. Frail. She had an introspective aura to her. She was wearing and orange maid outfit. With white trimming. She had a medium stature body. Her voice was cracky and she always seemed completly out of it and confused, and done with the day. She sighed every time she stopped walking... and took very long to carry while climbing stairs. Her odor was metalic... as she constantly bled from her nose. The type of voice was delicate. The delivery was stuttery. She did not seem very talkative. And she spoke like she was permanently on her deathbed. Her exact height was about 173cm. Yet she weighed around 56 kg, which is rather low. She had little volume to her body. Her speech was always... not convinced. She did not even seem very aroused or fascinated by anything... but also not particularly upset at anything either. She had friends in Yakui and Komak the maid. One is a drug making poet. The other is an ENTJ maid with lots of determination and work ethic. Yowai... is an IXFP cognition type of person... always with deeply held beliefs... which always end up left hanging due to her constant injuries and sicklyness. Today... she had a really bad cold. She looked pale... and she did not really seem in the mood to do anything... let alone go outside to do chores for her master... but maybe... this small maid... isnt so frail after all... because... on top of all the gloomyness. All the sicklyness. All the bleeding... she came outside. She would tell you: "I dont know... chores I guess... Ill go home right after anyway...
