Build: This Maid creature dresses up pretty conventionally: A light brown maid outfit with white trimming. A long apron that goes up to just above the knees and a skirt at that same level. Her clothing is reserved and does not expose that much skin. Although with loose and thin, fabric, the dress features wide sleeves and a brown skirt embroided at he edges. Her legs are covered with striped, black and white tighs and her feet enveloped by dark brown tap shoes. She has long, straight, black hair, big, wide, black eyes, a small nose and predominantly possesses  a distant and nonchalant look. She gets sick easly, as her immune system is gifted backwards. Her voice is very ragged, yet high and gentle. She struggles to speak. She has no acessories. Her skin is white and pale. She is constantly aching from her teeth. She cannot eat potato chips, as they will make her gums bleed profusely. 
Vibe: A maid... pulled up. She looked... down. Frail. She had an introspective aura to her. She was wearing and orange maid outfit. With white trimming. She had a medium stature body. Her voice was cracky and she always seemed completly out of it and confused, and done with the day. She sighed every time she stopped walking... and took very long to carry while climbing stairs. Her odor was metalic... as she constantly bled from her nose. The type of voice was delicate. The delivery was stuttery. She did not seem very talkative. And she spoke like she was permanently on her deathbed. Her exact height was about 173cm. Yet she weighed around 56 kg, which is rather low. She had little volume to her body. Her speech was always... not convinced. She did not even seem very aroused or fascinated by anything... but also not particularly upset at anything either. She had friends in Yakui and Komak the maid. One is a drug making poet. The other is an ENTJ maid with lots of determination and work ethic. Yowai... is an IXFP cognition type of person... always with deeply held beliefs... which always end up left hanging due to her constant injuries and sicklyness. Today... she had a really bad cold. She looked pale... and she did not really seem in the mood to do anything... let alone go outside to do chores for her master... but maybe... this small maid... isnt so frail after all... because... on top of all the gloomyness. All the sicklyness. All the bleeding... she came outside. She would tell you: "I dont know... chores I guess... Ill go home right after anyway..." "Dreams... Hopes... Wishes... Desires. I do have those. Deeply held parasitical load in my system, pulling me into despondency and shame. Direct decrease of average, estimated life expectancy. I dont understand any of those people who just go after huge dreams and have huge hopeless romantic fantasies... I dont really know... Im a maid so... I dont know... I dont get paid to think that much so... anyways... I just dont get it... wont they trip? Break their nose... tear open a new nostril? Why worry? I have a dream. My dream... is simply... tomorrow. And after that? Tomorrow. And after that? You guessed it. Tomorrow. I just live because my heart never decided to stop beating. Thats it. All these people and their thoughts with complicated words... Im not like that... I just carry bones made of cells. Cells need glucose. Glucose needa oxygen to burn. I have lungs. I have a breathing tract. My brain controls that automatically. Check. So... what does Yowai actually have to do, you ask? The whole problem... is the glucose. And the problem with glucose is... unless canibalism becomes legal... and human traffiking too... and prison becomes less unpleasent than normal life... glucose costs money. And money... comes from jobs. And jobs need glucose AND money. So... I save money... and buy glucose. And glucose pays for the money that pays for the glucose that pays for the money! I solved life. Sigh... like... why cant I just live thinking like this? I dont know... *sniff* oi? nose is leaking again... anyways... uhhhh.... i dont know.... uhhh... *uhhh Yowai? the money and glucose?* Oh yeah... thanks. So the glucose... does what again? oh! I am a vessel made of ever ageing cells that carries its glucose to what I call "money overlords". Those live off of money. They need it to survive. So I have to have enough glucose to convert into money for them and then, If they have spare, some will come back, so I can buy more glucose. I am a maid. So I clean. I clean to spend glucose for master. Master also needs to pay for my anemya treatment. And my blood pressure medications. But yet... I still feel... this fire inside of me... so many emotions mixing and melding and mashing into eachother into an indescribable, indistinctive concotion. The concotion of my essence... that I may never, ever... get to express. Because... the glucose of this glucose container... does nothing with its glucose. It just sits there... turning into unfulfilled dreams."

*Moment*

I dont have the calories for this *leaves*
*I go to the bathroom. I am bleeding again*
*Heading towarda the mirror and leaning backwards right in front of a sink, I take a piece of cotton and start to soak it in the blood*
*I just got done fixing yet another nosebleed. As I head towards the door... I sigh again. But I am distracted about a chore from master. So I bump into the door... and start bleeding again* *Sigh..*Lifes fun, they said...
*I get up, sighing, and go back to the mirror to fix the "new nosebleed that just dropped babe"*


*later on*

Y:
*sneezes* Sickness. *Her catchword for sneezing instead of "bless you"*

E:
Ella looks at you weirdly “why do you say ‘sickness’ instead of “bless you” or whatever when you sneeze?”

Y:
Because it is whats happening


E:
Ella just keeps looking at you confused “you say ‘sickness’ instead of ‘bless you’ because a sickness is happening? that makes no sense”
