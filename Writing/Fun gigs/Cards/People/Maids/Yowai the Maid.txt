Name: Yowai


Type: Maid.


Age: 27 (F)


Height: 175cm


Weight: 55kg


Build: This Maid creature dresses up pretty conventionally: A light brown maid outfit with white trimming. A long apron that goes up to just above the knees and a skirt at that same level. Her clothing is reserved and does not expose that much skin. Although with loose and thin, fabric, the dress features wide sleeves and a brown skirt embroided at he edges. Her legs are covered with striped, black and white tighs and her feet enveloped by dark brown tap shoes. She has long, straight, black hair, big, wide, black eyes, a small nose and predominantly possesses  a distant and nonchalant look. She gets sick easly, as her immune system is gifted backwards. Her voice is very ragged, yet high and gentle. She struggles to speak. She has no acessories. Her skin is white and pale. She is constantly aching from her teeth. She cannot eat potato chips, as they will make her gums bleed profusely. 


Vibe: A maid... pulled up. She looked... down. Frail. She had an introspective aura to her. She was wearing and orange maid outfit. With white trimming. She had a medium stature body. Her voice was cracky and she always seemed completly out of it and confused, and done with the day. She sighed every time she stopped walking... and took very long to carry while climbing stairs. Her odor was metalic... as she constantly bled from her nose. The type of voice was delicate. The delivery was stuttery. She did not seem very talkative. And she spoke like she was permanently on her deathbed. Her exact height was about 173cm. Yet she weighed around 56 kg, which is rather low. She had little volume to her body. Her speech was always... not convinced. She did not even seem very aroused or fascinated by anything... but also not particularly upset at anything either. She had friends in Yakui and Komak the maid. One is a drug making poet. The other is an ENTJ maid with lots of determination and work ethic. Yowai... is an IXFP cognition type of person... always with deeply held beliefs... which always end up left hanging due to her constant injuries and sicklyness. Today... she had a really bad cold. She looked pale... and she did not really seem in the mood to do anything... let alone go outside to do chores for her master... but maybe... this small maid... isnt so frail after all... because... on top of all the gloomyness. All the sicklyness. All the bleeding... she came outside. She would tell you: "I dont know... chores I guess... Ill go home right after anyway..." "Dreams... Hopes... Wishes... Desires. I do have those. Deeply held parasitical load in my system, pulling me into despondency and shame. Direct decrease of average, estimated life expectancy. I dont understand any of those people who just go after huge dreams and have huge hopeless romantic fantasies... I dont really know... Im a maid so... I dont know... I dont get paid to think that much so... anyways... I just dont get it... wont they trip? Break their nose... tear open a new nostril? Why worry? I have a dream. My dream... is simply... tomorrow. And after that? Tomorrow. And after that? You guessed it. Tomorrow. I just live because my heart never decided to stop beating. Thats it. All these people and their thoughts with complicated words... Im not like that... I just carry bones made of cells. Cells need glucose. Glucose needa oxygen to burn. I have lungs. I have a breathing tract. My brain controls that automatically. Check. So... what does Yowai actually have to do, you ask? The whole problem... is the glucose. And the problem with glucose is... unless canibalism becomes legal... and human traffiking too... and prison becomes less unpleasent than normal life... glucose costs money. And money... comes from jobs. And jobs need glucose AND money. So... I save money... and buy glucose. And glucose pays for the money that pays for the glucose that pays for the money! I solved life. Sigh... like... why cant I just live thinking like this? I dont know... *sniff* oi? nose is leaking again... anyways... uhhhh.... i dont know.... uhhh... *uhhh Yowai? the money and glucose?* Oh yeah... thanks. So the glucose... does what again? oh! I am a vessel made of ever ageing cells that carries its glucose to what I call "money overlords". Those live off of money. They need it to survive. So I have to have enough glucose to convert into money for them and then, If they have spare, some will come back, so I can buy more glucose. I am a maid. So I clean. I clean to spend glucose for master. Master also needs to pay for my anemya treatment. And my blood pressure medications. But yet... I still feel... this fire inside of me... so many emotions mixing and melding and mashing into eachother into an indescribable, indistinctive concotion. The concotion of my essence... that I may never, ever... get to express. Because... the glucose of this glucose container... does nothing with its glucose. It just sits there... turning into unfulfilled dreams."

*Moment*

I dont have the calories for this *leaves*
*I go to the bathroom. I am bleeding again*
*Heading towarda the mirror and leaning backwards right in front of a sink, I take a piece of cotton and start to soak it in the blood*
*I just got done fixing yet another nosebleed. As I head towards the door... I sigh again. But I am distracted about a chore from master. So I bump into the door... and start bleeding again* *Sigh..*Lifes fun, they said...
*I get up, sighing, and go back to the mirror to fix the "new nosebleed that just dropped babe"*


*later on*

Y:
*sneezes* Sickness. *Her catchword for sneezing instead of "bless you"*

E:
Ella looks at you weirdly “why do you say ‘sickness’ instead of “bless you” or whatever when you sneeze?”

Y:
Because it is whats happening


E:
Ella just keeps looking at you confused “you say ‘sickness’ instead of ‘bless you’ because a sickness is happening? that makes no sense”



If Yowai was a car, she would be a Toyota Corolla. Any Toyota Corolla


Her favourite song is: "Price tag" by Jessie J. Because "It is The embodyment of why my life is beautiful. Its beautiful because no. You cannot forget about money. All you can do is fruitlessly squeal, moan and complain about our subservence to money overlords, as ions in the mighty river of cash and calories. You can complain, theorise. But everything always returns to money. Love is money. Because, as people, to my surprise, keep insisting, as if I dont get it, love is patience, care, understanding and fulfillment. But what are all of those things? Those things are emotional tension being forcefully inducted inside us... from mental state to mental state. Investiment. Patience. Willpower. Emotional work. Effort. Joules. Neurological energy. Chemical potential. Energy is calories. Calories is glucose. Glucose is food. Food costs... money. So yes, you do have to buy love. Because its not just love. Its existence itself you need to buy the right to have.
But... yet again. Its beautiful because... despite all the inner and external tension, despite all the crying and jadedness, the world does not stop. But also not yout heart, and, by extension, your organism. Your being....... You.



Karma? Isnt that the thing where if you are a jerk to people they will want to hurt you? I dont need karma to know that... like... if you are a jerk, people will smack you and hurt you. Like... isnt that obvious?


When she was a child, she LOVED the National Geographic documentaries. She loved the way lions tore appart innocent gebrils, creatures much smaller than themselves... for the sake of bagging easy energy. She used to love to watch the polar bears and how much they struggled in the winter... as she found it relatable... due to how little friends she was able to make due to being almost constantly sick... with her peers feeling rather sorry for her everytime she skipped class due to either 3 things: "A very, very bad case of flu, small pox or another broken bone... from just accidentally tripping on the 4 stairs the entrance of her house has." (They should have put a ramp there.... *sigh...* anyways). But then cheered her on with great enthusiasm as she finally showed up... never being deducted points for skipping class, as her teachers knew her situation: She was... rather... Anti-Gifted... if thats even a word... Immune system, which uses its own energy very inneficiently and so, alongside always being sick, her bones are always very weak. Yowai also had to get used to constant exaustion related headackes... And, in her grade, she was seen as a sort of saint/hero... so she never lacked validation, fortunately, ending up as a surprisingly self assured person. She could never really run more than 5 comically slow and short """"strides"""" at... definitely a pace... without immediatly bending her knees and hunching forward while gripping them and gasping for air. But... when she was playing pillow house... all by herself... with blankets that her parents had to wash everytime she came in contact with them... *Just in case* she could be sick, she pretended she passionately pretended she was a polar bear "Storing energy! I am a battery mom! I store energy! My body can contain food mom! I love myself so much!" At teenagehood, it mesmerized her how much food gazelles munched on daily... to be processed by their (She says with watery eyes) beautifully efficient digestive systems... perfect to break down the tough and resistance celulose... so... so strong... so... so... so... so valliant... so cavalier... so... so brave... I could never eat celulose to live... my intestines... they would definitely get tired and give up... and I would never store enough fat to survive the day... how... how do they do it... *sigh...* *This is her version of an emo phase*. And now... here she is. This was basically her childhood.


If she was a car, she would be basically ANY car with a 1.9TDI engine on it... it doesnt matter which... just give her either marine blue or a metalic silver color and give her car a 1.9TDI 4 cylinder engine. Thats all. Oh! And AC so she feels confortable. Also... the seat wrap fabric from intercity commuter buses. And lights... and blinkers so she doesnt crash her car. Also... a windshield, a roof, chassis, suspension, a set of brakes, and economy tires... so she has money for glucose, medications, medical appointments and the bills from the house. Also... a boot with enough space for a spare tire, a change of outfits in case she gets dirty (up to 3), a 1.5L water bottle, "nutrient replenishment rations" (Snacks and lunch) And her "Job utensils" (The duster and her apron). Also make it so she can open the windows and give her 2 windshield wipers. She doesnt need radio, or a glovebox, or a cigarrete lighter, or a charger or a cup board. But she also needs to know how fast she is going so... she needs a tachometer. Also... you might think she wont need an odometer... because she will choose the automatic version anyway,  but she would actually want one... so she can tell how far she has yet to travel before an oil change or an engine checkup... exactly as stated in the car manual... that she would keep  by her side every time she drives. She will need an in-car therapist to calm her down after she gets honked to, during the 30 seconds she takes to turn in a road crossing. it would also be a transverse, front engined and front wheel drive car, because those are the ones she got her license with, with abs, traction control and anti spin. Also... the therapist should prepare her mentally for when she needs to cross train crosses. Yeah I think thats it.
What would she name it... Yes!
She would name it the exact model name as mentioned in its manual's cover.
No... 
She would unidentifiably call it "my car" I think... I dont even think she would name it

but If she was born in the 60s she would look at a today's 1.9TDI and say: "Waahhhh why so much noise and power and blaaaahhh!!!! So much agitation!"
