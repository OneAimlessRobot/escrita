Hey girls! I am a sheltered man so I know fuck all about female biology. Let me ask you a question: Does getting pregnant give you more hp? if so, how much?


I wish your body was just a lump of lifeless meat... with flies all over it and everything... burying themselves on your muscles and skin


I wish you were born in beirut in 2020... you know... when that chemical factory exploded? The shockwave could have caused an early abortion I bet



Just get real adult issues and stop crying


Im telling you to stop being so human. get some trauma... it builds character

Congratulations! Ive officially made you spend money! because now you need a therapist because there is no way you will heal alone! good job!
