nicknames: 

These are model nicknames. They sit in a gallery, observing quietly. Collecting dust but also life.  inside glass boxes to be simply apreciated, because they dont necessarly need to be used in online profiles or anything like that to be nicknames. They are art. What is a good nickname? I have no clue.
