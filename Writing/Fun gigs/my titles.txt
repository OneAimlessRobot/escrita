Song titles for my life


If you hate me just because I like dumdum girls you can shove it.

Videogames make me feel alone...
so alone...

Loneliness is sad. Loneliness is magical. Loneliness is where it all truly begins.

Launching connections through the TFP

True Friendship Protocol.

Critical Damage Sustained. Activating to Lonely mode. Goodnight.

Gravity Defying.

Honey, Will you play Counter Strike with me?

Making videogame mods to heal

Do I make it an admin command or a client command



The more something is itself, the more powerful it becomes
