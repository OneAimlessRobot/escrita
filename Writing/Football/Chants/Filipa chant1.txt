Title: Let Fun Happen!
Vibe: *Let! fun! ha! pen!* *Clap!* *Clap! Clap! Clap!* *Clap!* 
*Let! fun! ha! pen!* *Clap!* *Clap! Clap! Clap!* *Clap!* *Let! fun! ha! pen!* After my team lost their chance to move out of district level... we all sat on the pitch... contemplating everything... every expectation... every demand... every self critical, heavy talk musing... every belief. So... as our opponents left celebrating... we all sat there... as it had become all too familiar... at home soil. Our old fans... every pothole... every deformation... every bump... we sat on top of it all... after going through team, after team... we knew the pitch like our homes bathrooms... we trained on rain, sun, wind and... there... there was an earthquake once... and we saved ourselves... by running to here... but yet... the fans continue... *Let! fun! ha! pen!* *Clap!* *Clap! Clap! Clap!* *Clap!* 
*Let! fun! ha! pen!* *Clap!* *Clap! Clap! Clap!* *Clap!* *Let! fun! ha! pen!* are they dumb? we lost... right? *sniff* we... lost... right? *This was awesome!* *clap clap clap clap* *This was awesome!* *clap clap clap clap clap* *This was awesome!* So I get up... my teamatea follow... some hanging by anothers shoulder... and the chants devolve into roars... and... unissin clapping... with flashes... the flashes... *sniff* The flashes burned into me... a tear in my eye... the night... the fog. So then... we leave the pitch. No music on my phone. Nothing. We all pack our stuff. We greet eachother. *See you in training!* *Seeya!* *Seeya!* *Goodbye!* Goodbye guys... I get dropped by the bus at home. Then grab my keys from my sports back, twist it inside the hole, enter my appartment, turn on the lights. Then... I take a sigh... head to the kitchen, grab some takeaway from the fridge... eat. Then... I dress up, shower, wash my teeth... and go to bed, all while feeling... this oddly healing silence... thats both haunting, eerie, personal and grounding. So surreal... I them close my eyes... and fall asleep.
