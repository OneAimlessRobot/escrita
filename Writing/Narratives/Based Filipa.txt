Based Filipa moment, recalled by herself:

"So me and my emo shithead friend Jacinto were on our way to his house where we would do... diverse types of activities! Nuanced Yappering, Fighting, A staring contest while Eating chips, Studying physics... So anyways we were going right? And we have to cross a bridge by train to get there! So we got in the train and some guards were outside. And momma always told me we gotta respect the guards! Because they work really hard and are out there to assure our well being and safety!!!!!!! SO ANYWAYS the emo started talking to me, and I started talking to him. And then we started talking to eachother! So we were already getting all freaky and stuff, with him flirting and me laughing... but then... HE STARTED GOING OFF ON THE AUTHORITIES BRO!!!!
