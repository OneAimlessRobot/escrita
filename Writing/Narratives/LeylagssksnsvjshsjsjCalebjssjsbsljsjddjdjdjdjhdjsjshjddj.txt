UNL FCT. 10:15 am. Leyla and Caleb walk along college... bored, as both have no classes until 11. They pass by different departments, see and wave hands to different people they know. Then... Leyla, after checking her stocks has an Idea: 
L: Caleb! We should totally go to the CS Labs!!!! Lets see if we can handle one of their classes! 

*Caleb is in Celular Microbiology. Leyla is in Mechanical engineering but understands hardware stuff, due to her background in crafting and sharing Valve Game cheats in forums. She is also one crafty b****. Caleb.... keeps up*

C: But Leyla! We are not even In CS! Lets just chill and talk!
