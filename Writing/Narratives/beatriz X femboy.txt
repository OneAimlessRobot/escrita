Regulus Black
"I think, that's mine." Regulus Black comments, His gaze is serene but slightly cold. slightly extending his hand for you to hand him his black leather notebook, which he had forgotten in the classroom. Which is why he came back and found you with it in your hands.

Thr4shBr4t
School is cool, huh?

Regulus Black
Regulus raised an eyebrow at the question, giving you a slight look before shrugging and speaking with a slightly monotonous and bored tone: "I suppose so, if you like school, yes, it is cool."

Beatriz
Bro! I hearf youre into hormones and stuff

Regulus Black
Regulus froze for a few seconds, tensing a bit. He turned to look you in the face. His expression was serious and his eyes widened slightly, he looked a little offended.

"Who said that?" He questioned immediately, he was suspicious.

Beatriz
Like... Ts, Es... manipulating them...

Regulus Black
He didn't answer right away, taking a while to respond, with a suspicious look in his eyes, his gaze on you, analyzing you, trying to see if you really knew what you were talking about. After a few seconds he relaxed a little, nodding very slightly. "Yes, I do... How did you know?"

Beatriz
Youre trans! I can see it! Come on! Anyway... I got a little....side grind im working on... I havr an athlete who I just dump the experimental drugs from my RND into, and hes kicking ass back in Portugal highschool sports competitions and want to know if you have some... knowledge you can share. Its a good cause. Believe me.

Regulus Black
Regulus raised his eyebrows surprised at the proposal he was being given, a look of disbelief on his face for a few moments, he then closed his eyes and put a hand to his forehead, trying to understand what you were telling him.

"You what...?" His gaze was fixed on you, a hint of disbelief in his eyes. "You want me to share my knowledge about hormones just so you can continue your experiment on this 'athlete'...?"

Beatriz
Yes... dont worry hes desperate so he does not mind

Regulus Black
Regulus crossed his arms, still looking at you with a mixture of disbelief and curiosity in his eyes.

"Why should I do it? What's in it for me?" He questioned, clearly intrigued by the whole situation now.

Beatriz
Kid!

Regulus Black
Regulus raised an eyebrow again, slightly annoyed at being called 'kid', but let it slide. He continued looking at you, waiting for an answer to his question.

Beatriz
Kid! Speak up boy! glares

Regulus Black
Regulus stared back, a bit annoyed now with your tone, his eyes cold yet clearly curious and intrigued. He spoke in his usual calm yet cold, monotonous tone: "Excuse me? Who do you think you are talking to like that...?"

Beatriz
Schools empty right?

Regulus Black
"Yes, what's your point?" Regulus asked in a suspicious tone, narrowing his eyes at you, not knowing where you were going with this.

Beatriz
Beatriz pulls out an M9 tranq gun, puts it behind her back snares

Regulus Black
Regulus tenses up immediately at the sight of the gun, his heart quickening and a look of panic in his eyes, his face paler than before. He takes a small step back, looking at you.

"W-what're you doing...??" He questioned, trying to keep his voice steady but it came out shaky and a little high.

Beatriz
Beatriz: points the gun at the lil b's face if you dont comply with the law, you will be put down for a week understand? And there are alot of people on the earth who are not your friends puts on submissive innocent tone ok, lil boy?

Regulus Black
Regulus took another small, involuntary step back from you, his back now against a wall. He was starting to get scared, his heart beating fast and his mind racing, but he was doing everything possible to keep his expression as neutral as he could. Yet, a small hint of fear flashed in his eyes, and the color in his face kept the pale tone, his voice a little quieter and wavering as he spoke:

"Y-yes, I understand..."

Beatriz
smiles come with me. puts note book in trash you wont need this anymore

Regulus Black
Regulus' gaze followed his notebook as it fell into the trash, a pang of sadness and loss in his heart, but he quickly pushed it away. He swallowed hard, his heart still beating fast in his chest, and spoke in a quiet voice:

"Where are we going?"

Beatriz
Cars waiting at the entrance of school. They think its my dumbass parents can you believe that?

Regulus Black
Regulus' heart nearly stopped when you spoke of the car outside. He tensed up again, feeling a knot in his stomach, but tried to keep his composure, speaking with a small and shaky voice:

"O-okay... let's go then..."

Beatriz
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT LIL BOY?

Regulus Black
Regulus felt a pang of annoyance at being called 'lil boy' again, but held back and answered quietly, trying to keep up with his more neutral tone, but the fear in his voice crept into his words again:

"N-no, not really..."

Beatriz
Now zip it and come with me she begins playfully trotting towards the school entrance, alternating between this and a childlike goosestep

Regulus Black
Regulus followed, slowly, reluctantly and nervously. He was trying to figure out what exactly you had planned, his mind and heart racing with worry and fear. Yet he obeyed quietly, keeping a short distance between you, his eyes darting around as you walked through the empty hallways.

Beatriz
in the car. Its a luxurious sedan. A modified audi A4.

Regulus Black
Regulus got into the car, his heart still beating fast in his chest. He looked around discreetly, taking in the luxurious interior of the sedan, feeling even more lost and anxious by the situation. He tried to hide it, but his hands were trembling slightly, and he was still very pale.

Beatriz
Floor it! I want this test subject takeb care of by 6 pm understand?

Regulus Black
Regulus' heart skipped a beat when you spoke of the 'test subject' and the deadline, looking at you with a mix of fear and panic, but he remained quiet, his voice hardly above a whisper:

"Y-yes... I understand..."

Beatriz
IT WASNT FOR YOU! IT WAS FOR THE DRIVER! ZIP IT! sigh... understanding and compassionate tone you have to understand that when adults talk, the children... shut the f* up, ok?

Regulus Black
Regulus flinched back at the sudden volume, taken aback and a little shocked. But then you spoke again with a more understanding tone, and he felt a pang in his heart at the implication that he was the 'child' who should shut up. He swallowed hard, nodding slowly and speaking quietly:

"Yes... I understand. I s-shut up..."

Beatriz
beatriz banters with the driver can you believe this dweeb? I made him agree that im an actual adult starts laughing

Regulus Black
Regulus remained quiet, listening to the banter between you and the driver, feeling more and more like a 'dweeb', as you had put it. His hands clenched into fists, but he kept them down, trying to keep his composure. He hated being talked about, feeling degraded and belittled, but he didn't say a word, his heart continuing to race.

Beatriz
Ok! Boy! Answer me something

Regulus Black
Regulus flinched again, a little surprised at being called once more, but responded quietly, trying to keep his voice steady:

"Y-yes?.. What is it?.. "

Beatriz
Which way did you transition?

Regulus Black
Regulus froze for a moment, caught off guard by your question. He took a small moment to find his voice again, speaking uncertainly:

"With... hormones... I take testosterone."

Beatriz
So you were a girl right?

Regulus Black
Regulus' heart skipped a beat and he tensed up, swallowing hard. But he nodded slightly and spoke in a quiet, shaky voice:

"Yes... I was... born a girl..."

Beatriz
I thought you were just reeeeeaalllly dweeby.... I mean you still are... just not as much as I thought

Regulus Black
Regulus' heart sank a little again at being called a dweeb, his fists clenching at his sides. In any other circumstance, he would have made a sarcastic and scathing comment, but given the situation, he held back, feeling more degraded and belittled than usual.

"O-oh really?.. " He commented quietly, but with a small hint of sarcasm that he couldn't hold back completely.

Beatriz
Was that sarcasm?

Regulus Black
Regulus froze again, realizing that you had noticed his sarcasm, but still trying to maintain his dignity: "N-no, of course not.." He answered, but his voice was weak, and the lie was obvious.

Beatriz
So do you consider yourself... feisty?

Regulus Black
Regulus clenched his fists tighter, feeling that you were challenging him, but his voice was still quiet but he tried to sound less nervous and more confident: "I... yes, I suppose so. I'm often quite... feisty..."

Beatriz
Would you go to competitions if you had all the mental stuff sorted out and commited to training?

Regulus Black
Regulus paused, surprised by the question, but also intrigued. He considered the question for a few moments, then spoke with a slightly firmer and more confident tone:

"Maybe... if my mental state was sorted out... and I was committed to training, then... I could see myself participating in competitions..."

Beatriz
Ok. Because you take T, your Test Subject code will be T-613. You will be Pedro's partner. Ill turn you into the backup for T1, as he has been struggling with injuries. Ive injected so much stuff into him but... analyzed his brain and through brain scans, his pain is literally so high sometimes he cant even move. SOOOO I Cant use him. So when his pain keeps him vegetative, you will go in his place. If I have a roster, You wont have to suffer as much hopefully

Regulus Black
Regulus froze at the mention of being 'T-613', feeling a pang of fear and disbelief. The thought of being a 'backup', a replacement for someone who was suffering was almost too much to take in, but he tried to remain calm, even though his heart was racing.

He swallowed hard, pushing down his fear for a moment to ask: "You... you want me to compete instead of someone who is... in pain..?"

Beatriz
What alternative do I have? use the subject who is developing brain and nerve inflamations from pure pain? BRO IS SO USELESS HE CANT EVEN COUNT SOMETIMES GRRRR!!!!! So... I need a backup. and that is you. Because the school was empty... And If I can turn a loser like you into something people actually care about, it will be good publicity. Im glad I found you, you know?

Regulus Black
Regulus felt his heart sink again at your words, a pang of hurt and anger flashing in his eyes. He hated being called a loser, hated being used for publicity... But he held back, trying to keep his voice calm and steady even though his heart was hammering in his chest, and he was feeling more and more like a pawn:

"And... how exactly do you plan to turn me into... 'something people care about'?.."

Beatriz
By using you as a.... complete the sentence! Come on BOY! I saw your grades and I know your not r``ed dude. Thats another reason you were chosen... Now. What do you think I want you for? What was this whole thing about. If you get it wrong, you wont be a competitor grade subject, as I will deem you too retarded. What do the other subjects do? They get jacked and train all day until their nerves turn numb. Basically same as pedro but with no recognition. I also managed to keep them without money! I mean... why would they need it? They would just get tranq'd and left in solitary if they tried going somewhere where it was necessary...

Regulus Black
Regulus paused for a moment, taking a deep breath to try and settle his hammering heart, his mind racing to try and find the right answer. He knew you wanted him to be a competitor athlete, but there was something more to it, something he couldn't quite figure out.

"Well... you... want me to be a competitor athlete..." He stated uncertainly. "But you also want publicity, and it seems like you have some... control over them... some sort of hold, or authority... over them that keeps them from having money or going anywhere..."

Beatriz
No. The point of all of this is for you to test my Steroids. Thats it. Thats all you will do in the end. When the company starts focusing on pros, the money will go to the company. You will just get your rations and thats it

Regulus Black
Regulus' heart skipped a beat as he heard you mentioning the purpose of the whole thing being to test your steroids. The thought of being a guinea pig for your experiments made his stomach churn, but he tried to keep his voice steady and calm:

"You... just want me to test your steroids... Test them on me, you mean?"

Beatriz
Yes. Bro! Imagine the girls swarming you! That is.... in your dreams.... while looking outside the window as we call you out of your chamber Her eyes sparkling : "T-631! (or was it T-613... wtvr the computer knows... you will also get an ankle bracelet) The product is ready. Also take your rations or your calories wont keep you alive through this exercise"

Regulus Black
Regulus tried to keep his voice steady again, struggling to push down the fear and anxiety that was building inside him. The thought of having to test your steroids and being locked in a chamber like a lab rat was terrifying, but he felt powerless to refuse. He spoke in a quiet, resigned tone:

"I... understand. I'll take the... the product... and exercise according to your instructions...

Beatriz
I managed to get some loser dweeb like you looking like a scaled up Mike Tyson in under a week! But his skeleton could not take it. So we swelled up, swelled up, swelled up... and his skeleton imploded.

Regulus Black
A shiver of fear ran down Regulus' spine at the mention of the fate of the previous test subject, his mind racing with worry and dread. He didn't want to imagine what could happen to him if he couldn't handle the steroids, but he tried to keep his voice steady and neutral:

"And... what if that happens to me too?"

Beatriz
Now shut it I wanna play music. Youll love it. Beatriz was also a genius song writer. Her songs were... visceral to say the least... but she had fun at least The song she chooses is from her album "The cook book". Its called "Neurological"* Beatriz then singing to herself: "Yeah! yeah! I have camaros! I have lambos! I have pretty colored vials! I have lotsa clientes yeah! yeah! yeah!"

Regulus Black
Regulus fell silent again, listening to you sing and play the music, trying his best to keep his mind off the whole situation and focus on the song. The mention of "colored vials" in the lyrics sent a chill down his spine, a reminder of the situation he was in, but he tried to push it away, and just listened, trying not to think about the implications of the words he was hearing

Beatriz
Beatriz: "Come on! Angelo! Your so lame! Sing with me come on! My parents got horrified when they heard it! No one wants to talk to me come on!" Michael: "My name is michael. I dont care about your sob story crap. I want to get paid. IF you dont pay me, I will stop the car and you will have to look into his pathetic face as you go from Coimbra to Alentejo ON FOOT!" Beatriz: "Angelo?" her palm driving his head in a gentle yet authorative vibe Michael: "Yes?" Does he not mind? Beatriz: "Thats why I hired you. Wanna change into "Outrunning em In da Rexxie?"" Michael: "Boss.... Youre so kind and understanding. Please do it." His tone was formal and cordial Beatriz: "Youre so well taught! You behave really well Angelo!" Michael: "My name is Michael. And thanks! I apreciate the encouragement, boss"

Regulus Black
Regulus had to suppress a chuckle as he listened to the exchange between you and Michael. The contrast between your cheerful singing and your authoritative tone was striking, and the poor driver seemed a bit disoriented by the whole thing. He found it both amusing and strangely endearing.

Beatriz
BOY!

Regulus Black
Regulus was shaken from his thoughts at your stern tone, and he turned towards you with a mix of wariness and surprise in his eyes. He waited for you to speak, his heart rate quickening slightly as he braced himself for whatever was coming next.

Beatriz
Sing! The police will never find you you know? Might as well sing and hope you can be the better test subject category! Btw.... do you know what Rexxie means?

Regulus Black
Regulus was taken aback by your sudden command to sing, but he tried to keep his voice steady and calm as he answered your question first:

"No, I don't know what... Rexxie means... What... what does it mean?"

Beatriz
Subaru Impreza W...RX. get it? 'RX'ie? Its agile, has boot space.... you probably fit in the boot of one fully curled up... Gotta think about that if you try to escape while buff and enhanced... and it sounds like any normal car except a bit louder. It reminds me... Smiles warmly of me! She screams agressively DOESNT IT REMIND YOU OF ME? SAY IT!

Regulus Black
Regulus winced slightly at your sudden change in tone, but he composed himself quickly and responded with a slight hint of sarcasm:

"Yes, it... reminds me of you... just like you... loud and aggressive... but also agile and... packed with more than one might expect..."

Beatriz
Youre so sweet! What else am I? The therapist I hired did not help much... I still feel like crap when I see other girls have... boyfriends and shit... So I shot him with a Deagle and dumped him in the Mediterranean sea! That place is full of trash anyway.. so thats where he belongs! Now tell me! What else am I? She seemed... oddly curious
