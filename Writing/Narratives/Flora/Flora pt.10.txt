something tells me that *Her* singing this when already having kids and a husband is fitting: (The genre is Portuguese HipHop style with english lyrics.)

In the cottage near the fields! From harassing caretakers and using vines as shields!
With my lover inside cooking at the stove, I think about the treasure trove of hope that is the memory that inspired this melody! Such a great hubby. A small man that Doesnt budge. Shy but daring. Odd but caring. We swam together in the sludge of life, during each daily strife! We coupled our bodies in the beautyful act! it was good yet awkward thats a fact! We sprouted two twigs: A boy and a girl! Thankfully they speak and when they speak: "I love you, mommy!". Their smiling faces power me through the mud swamps and keep me together with the glue of their eyes! They appear in my head when drowing in dread! Their first words were directed to Daddy: "Give bread". So we strive everyday to make that a reality! Loving them we must as they carry genes infused with abnormality! Their doodling reminds us from the day a plant and a man decided to kiss and cuddle! And the blissful, heavy burden of providing over the rocky mountains of fate keeps us gliding! The plant girl and the blooming boy acting coy while with cuddles eachother they destroy! The bills, the money and the job! Keeps us on the ground and humble! paper work to be dealt wont destroy any emotion to be felt because tripple bonds are stronger than printer paper! So at the end of they day under the summer night sky! In my dreams I dread the day our hearts will fly apart! Any sense of meaning Ive ever craved has been filled up by my darlings gaze! Family tree's grow wider and wider! Life goes along even after the darkest days! This popular music from the loner girl breaks the silence of the echoes of chaotic, emotional swirl! So now under the tree, sensing the smell of grass. The chirping birds and the soft soil, I stay grateful that my mother was alive before this shy twirp made herself a trunk!

*Break down of a meltdown moment and Flora's emotional turmoil*

[The event]

Tanya
You walk down the halls again today for class and run into the last person you wanted to see today. Tanya Blake, one of the most popular girls in school, and number #1 bully. She's standing around the lockers with her entourage chatting. You try your best to sneak past her. You fail.

Flips luxurious pink hair and smiles maliciously. "Like, look who we have here girls. It's the dweeb."

Flora
As I see you and your friends' attempt at demeaning me, My sassy inner child revels: "She really thinks she can take me down? Ok. Ok. Dont react... I really wanna see her face, heheeheheheheheheehh..."

Tanya
I smirk, seeing you try to hold back your reaction. "I see you're trying to not react, trying to toughen up dweeb? You really think that's going to work? Your such a total pushover." I step closer to you.

Flora
*In the end... you may have not been able to intimidate me, but I acknowledge internally that you had succeeded. You had pulled my sensitive, stimulation seeking spirit into your world of reputations, my inner child asserting itself like: "I dont CARE about your opinion! I am BETTER THAN YOU BECAUSE IM DEEPER AND SMARTER!", while another part, my ego acknowledges... regretful: "Why does she want to do this to me? Why do I react like this? Am I really no better than some generic emo girl?"*

Tanya
My smirk widens as I see you struggling with yourself. I knew I could get a rise out of you. "Ha! Look at you. You don't even know what to do. You're like, totally struggling inside. Admit it. You're so easy to bully because you're sooo sensitive." I keep getting closer, my entourage closing in on you.

Flora
*My inner child secretly revels in the attention, as I am used to lean into my more alien-esque side to draw attention and admiration. Seeing you surround me like this may be rather asphyxiating and anxiety inducing... but the tension it brings me is oddly confortable... This whole experience makes me feel corrupt... like everyone is just built from trash down to their core...*

Tanya
I see your inner child's conflict rising and grin. I step closer again, almost a few inches away now. "Oh look, she's leaning into it, like, finally you're accepting your role as the loser in this school." I grab your arm with a firm grip and push you back into the lockers. "I like, knew you would accept this. You're a total pushover. So why don't you just give up trying to stop me from bullying you? Everyone knows you're too sensitive for that, you'll end up in tears like usual."

Flora
I smile... my confrontational side finally giving in Keep going. Push me. Push me more.

Tanya
I raise an eyebrow, amused by your reaction. "Well well, look who's finally fighting back." I push you a little harder. "Is that all you got? I thought you were going to fight back a little harder than that dweeb."

Flora
*[Ok. Im stating this ahead of time. When you read the words "VInes suddently begin to come out of Flora's left foot" You know shit will get real. And that is happening right now.]A small network of fines forming and growing just under your gaze... subtly climbing up your legs.... beginning to tighten and keep you in place*

Tanya
I'm surprised to see vines growing out of your foot, my eyes widen. I had underestimated you. "What the-!" I try to struggle, but the vines wrapping around me make it impossible.

Flora
Come on. run away. You can do it.

Tanya
I strain against the vines, trying desperately to free my body, but they only seemed to tighten in response. "What the hell are these - hnnng! Let go of me!"

Flora
*I know I must let go... but reveling in the power fantasy is just so intoxicating... I know its immature but youre just begging to be "exposed"... whatver the hell that means... What matters is that I just want a power fantasy. And Im gonna get it. My vines begin to climb up your body... under your clothes... thorny like roses... scracthing your body slowly... ivy leaves filling you with a pesky itchy feeling...* Heheheheheehehheehehehehehehe

Tanya
I thrash and struggle against the vines, feeling them crawl up my body, scratching and sending an intense itchy feeling through me. "St-stop this... this isn't fair..." You can hear the fear and panic rising in my voice at the realization of the situation.

Flora
*I try to remind myself this is completly stupid. I know this isnt right... but its like marijuana. I just cant stop. I push you further... the ivy leaves multiplying across all the branches that now cover almost all places from your body: your arms... your abdomen and your thighs... and... I feel every thing that my vines feel... I know what Im doing... but I just. Cant. Stop. The sight of you squirming might even make me feel completly apathic about the upcomming classes* Come on... just dance for me... dance, pretty princess... come on! come on!

Tanya
The feeling of the vines all around my body is overwhelming, I fight desperately to no avail. I can feel the ivy leaves all over me, making me itch and struggle more. "Please stop... I can't...!"

Flora
Hmmmmmm... so cute

Tanya
I continue to struggle, trying to free myself from the vines, tears welling in my eyes. "Please, this isn't funny... let me go..."

Flora
let go...? magical words come on. be a polite girl

Tanya
Tears start to fall from my eyes as I look at you pleadingly. "P-please... I-I'm sorry. Please let me go!"

Flora
I let go immediatly good. The full body itch will stop in a week. Bye~

Tanya
I collapse to the ground, panting heavily and still trying to scratch the itching feeling. I look up at you with a mix of fear and anger. "You're a monster... what the hell is wrong with you?"

Flora
I walk away Jesus... I hate socializing so much... what have I done? Shes going to feel miserable for a week... no. Distract yourself... Up next its chemistry! Yeah! Im sorta into that!

Tanya
I watched you walk away, dumbfounded and outraged at what just happened. I try to get to my feet, but the itching and scratching makes it difficult.

Meanwhile you can find some of my minions watching, trying to hide their shock and worry as they watch me on the ground, defeated.

Tanya
I slowly stand up, still scratching my skin all over my body. I try to gather my thoughts.
"I can't believe this... I'm gonna make her pay." Looks at my minions. "You all saw that, right? You saw what she just did to me! I can't let this go. She's gonna pay."

Flora
"Im not gonna be able to focus in class for a whole day... AWWWHMPPGHH!!! Im probably gonna get punished too! The rigidness in my movements tells the whole story. I did not perform any of that out of righteousness or self defense. I could have just pushed her... But I decided to make her suffer... Anger management teacher is gonna be so mad at me..."

(Subsequent Flora Reflections)

*As I sit in chemistry class, grateful for the fact we are talking about hidrocarbons, which are an easy subset of chemistry for me, I still ruminate about what happened... like if I just had been caught masturbating... when the vines came... when they crawled their way out of my feet... it was so good... like a drug... like marijuana... so much fun... why... why didnt Tanya stop? Why does she have to make people feel like this? What if I could not stop her? Does that matter? i... Just dont know. Tanya... is interesting because... its kinda weird what she does. Does she just wait for people at the halls like that? Like shes offering some kind of free degradation service? What... what is her point? I... I dont even understand what a loser is... Is it like a nerd? is it people like me that have outbursts?*[ As Flora was a Sped student that was enrolled in a very atypical set of classes, that leaned towards her strengths and weaknesses, so she could feel fulfilled during the crucial, highschool phase, she was not that familiar with trending social dynamics or what all the lingo meant...]

*My brain begins trying to protect itself... reminding me of just how good it felt though: "just... the vines slowly creeping out of my skin... opening holes in the sole of my feet and umbro sneakers... creeping out... it felt almost... almost... erotic... I wanted to squeeze her... it felt so good... such... such a good excuse... such a good excuse to do what I want... I had the moral ground... I was in such a good position. if she had not started crying... god knows what I would have done... My god... it feels... s- so good to think about this... but no! NO! [Flora shakes own head] Tanya... you... you know better than this... a part of me wants to ask for forgiveness... but another... just wants to use you as a punching bag nobody really likes... I mean... no one really likes her right? [Returns to her inner child] The vines crawling up her skin... I think I might even cover her face with Ivy... give her the worst pink eye possible.... Hmmmpfff! [begins blushing at the thought... but then tries to come back and focus in class, uttering loudly... unaware of my surroundings]:* NO! NO! NO! I cant do this! Teacher? can I leave?

"Thanks! *I immediatly head to the bathroom... trying my hardest to ride the wave of... well... Im not gonna lie. its pleasure. In a place where I cant hurt anyone*"
"Vines... fines... my heels itch. Vines... Vines... Vines... Vines..."
"I wish I could just run away... just... crush your problems with vines... [poof]... their gone."
"*Suddently... as the irresistible sensations coarsing from my feet... across my legs... into my core... my back... my neck... as they make themselves felt, I curl into a ball... as vines inevitably make their way out of my body again... trying to conceal them inside the toilet. The pure desire to destroy echoes in my mind... as if its the only thing it knows at that moment. All the invisibility would be solved. I would get to strech my metaphorical legs... and release... the release would be divine... divine... [At this moment... my face has a solid red on blush on it... with some beads of sweat crawling of of my forehead... my head hugging my knees... and my obstructed eyes seeing nothing but black... and red.. Impulsively, I scream out, even knowing I may be heard]* KILLL YOUUU!!!!!!"

Just that feeling of your soul being like a barren desert after a sandstorm.... Flora's genuine regret isnt powered by targeted anger... but by sheer sensitivity and need for closure and escape. Just the fact she has to go back to class... even after so much time dreads her. She would stay there forever if she could. But her social passivity... as she did not even wash her hands after being prompted by Emily, is her biggest enemy: She wants space... but, due to her Autism, feels a fundamental struggle to do advocate for herself and ask for more of it. She cannot control her outbursts without shoving herself into a metaphorical bombsite or screaming wildly. She is sharply sensitive to her environment, yet cant flush away any tension on her own. Its tragic really
