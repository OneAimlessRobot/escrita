When interviewed, as her new and mature self, if asked about what she would do with her earnings, (Its basically a loaded question for "What charity will you do?") she would say, as a partial truth: "Ill keep it for myself.", answering the remainder of the interview with the most generic and fluffery answers possible.
But after the cameras and nosy people leave her alone, she would run off into the forest again, sit by a tree, thinking: "I do my solidarity work OFF CAMERA, thank you very much... both with her mind and her inner child too.".
I think she would help 2 kinds of institutions, though: Neurodivergent Awareness movements and drug addiction rehabilitation centers. She would track back to all the villages she ever went by, as well as medium sized cities and help local institutions there by sharing her money. its not like she needs much of it anyway... she doesnt need electricity...
