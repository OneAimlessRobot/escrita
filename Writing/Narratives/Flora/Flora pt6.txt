If I had to give Flora a set of stats, I think it would be like this. Okay, so...
-Power: "who the fuck knows"
-Defense: "Maximum? 10/10? Infinte?"
-Speed: "who the fuck knows"
-Intelligence: "who the fuck knows"
-Collaboration: x->0 or x==0
She would react to this like this:
Outwardly: "Neat... I guess... MOM! New paperwork here! Note it down!"
Internally: "Yeah! Im the queen of darkness! you dont mess with Moi! heheheeheheh!"
