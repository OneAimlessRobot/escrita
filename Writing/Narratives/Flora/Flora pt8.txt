*Another combat scene*
(alternate history)

So... this time, the place is the battleground of the hero-villain war before the one where Izuko and the others fought. All for One is there, just like Shigarraki, Twice, Dabi, etc... but not Toga (she was killed by flora in the last combat scene ive shared). The big 3 are in the fight, having prepared themselves along with the rest of the current generation as well as teachers like All Might, Aizawa and Present Mic. Both fronts were face to face... with the Villains barricaded ready to defend the hero Siege. In one moment, the heroes decide to strike. heroes split tasks, the big 3 being left responsible for dealing with All for One, along with All Might. The others deal with less prolific villans (bluntly... they are minions), and Dabi, Twice, etc. The streets are empty as they have been evacuated. Brawling Heroes and villains sprawl all over this set of city blocks... which... was conveniently close to a city park.

Out of nowhere, an unassuming girl... that no one could actually recall... and apparently was not evacuated shows up... uttering... in gentle, soothing, monotone wording: "Guys? Room for one more?"

She was unrecognizable for them. because... they dont recall ever even interacting with her and... even if they remembered her from highschool, she now had *no acne*. Bro... ok let me just say this: if the loner, outcast, misfit, at any point, loses their acne, and pulls up to whats suposed to be the final battle after being out of public memory for YEARS, You know shit will get real. She even pulled up wearing UMBROS! UMBROS WITH RIPPED SOLES AND UNTIED LACES!
(She was exuding PURE, peak crooked-Umbro energy, like... lets talk about this for a second: know those kids with no friends, weird habits, old ass clothes, smell like grass or even excrement/dirt all the time, bombazine pants, spend entire recesses alone, and wear umbros? And then Pull up to the recess area soccer painted-tarmac pitch and then they just tackle you to the ground, slide tackle, after slide tackle, not allowing you a second to dribble, and always go to class with at least 3 new scratches on their arm while also having scored a goal from midfield? That throws fits in the middle of class and no one pays attention until its time to see what grades they get? Thats crooked-Umbro energy)

Some heroes suddently shift focus to the strange, oddly cocky girl... 3 of them detaching from the main force to politely get her to immediatly scram. But... as they approach her, Flora, suddenly, grows thick vinnes from her femur and back muscles... burrowing herself under the earth.

They look strangefied... as they have no idea who this person even is... let alone quirks, backstory or even criminal history or links to villains.

Flora, then, suddently notices the presence of All for One himself on the battlefield. Flora at this time had found out who had killed her parents during her period of intentional-unintentional self-exile from society: it was him. They were nurturing her, gradually transforming this complete wildcard into a refined, powerful ally. So... knowing at the time she was not really attached to them in her own terms, but out of resigned acceptance, albeit she always felt this strange, comforting sensation every time she was begrudgingly forced to stare at her mommas eyes... during the anger management sessions... no weed... no running away. it felt... oddly purifying. And... she loved it, although she did not really know that. And now she knows just how much. She was now 26 years old. had learned plenty. Seen plenty. Improved, and regrown plenty. She borrows herself underground at the main battlefield... beginning to agressively expand and grow. She grew powerful, 1m thick branches in all directions... growing hundreds of small roots from them... planting thousands of seeds... consuming hundreds of kiliograms of dirt every 5 minutes. The earth was noticeably shaking... and shaking hard. it felt unstable. After some 7 minutes, Huge  trees suddently grew from the ground, from which the shaking made them drop pinecones and dehydrated fruits, Expanding. Trees grew, seeds dropped, she expanded. She was consuming tons and tons of soil at this point. Then... she stopped. She had individuated, merged herself with her inner child, now able to talk even transformed: "Hello dear peers! Its me. Flora. The weird tantrum girl. Remember the big 3? Ill let you know that there was one more. the 4th main student. I decided to flee a bit... but then got my mind together... continued studying to become a hero at college... learning loads of new stuff, Even passing math! I got a 15 in Abstract Algebra 505 guys! And learned loads more. And now Im back. And that bastard over there will pay. Now scram. Im going to work." They suddently remember: The attacks during the hero training, the odd girl that did not move and then disappeared. It was her! and now they were gonna see what she could do. Suddenly... channeling all her rage, she sprouted thousands of flowers across her colossal branches... ejecting metric ton after metric ton of paralyzing spores, which disoriented All For One. "Run dear friends! This gas is poisonous!" The gas began infiltrating All for Ones system, and after he was panting for control, Flora's branch network steadly, in one go, sprouted from the outside... taking water from the city's main water supply from undergound pipes, along with the loads and loads of minerals. In about 30 minutes, the top 30% of the humus layer of the park was gone. The banches climbed and climbed and climbed... eventually reaching all for one... and pulling down at him... wrapping him up with loads of little branches... that grew in size as flora pumped merciless ammounts of anti coagulant spores into the air... and dug her thorny branches into All for One's organism. But... All her effort was gonna be in vain, as All for One grabbed her two main branches, keeping Flora Stuck. She uttered, in an echoing, mature, yet gentle but thundering sequence of struggling gasps and sounds : "Gnn! gggHHHnnnn!!! gHNNNNG!" It could be heard for hundreds of meters away. She had covered just about the volume of the whole park in branches and spores. But then... All For One's Antibody quirk destroyed her branches... injecting some of his own into her... beginning to rot her from the inside. and then... in one fell motion, Set her whole network on fire... forcing her to literally cut her losses and go back to her previous form... now laying down on the ground... collapsed, unconscious and helpless. Aizawa saw her, and, wearing a gas mask he had gotten from a raided hardware store, quickly takes away flora into a nearby forest... digging up a hole for her quickly... and settling her down... with only her head above the ground... as he was still unsure how your body actually works and did not want to take any risks. He waited a couple minutes and, taking a hand to Flora's neck, relieved she still had a solid ammount of pulse, uttered as she unconsciously began quietly sipping at the soil's nutrients, once again, small leaves poking from her hair: "If we need you, we will summon you ok?" Then... the veteran teacher leaves.
