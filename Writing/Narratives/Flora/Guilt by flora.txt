Okay here comes the scene. Draw Flora in the bathroom stall, sitting on the toilet... haunted by the guilt induced by her own actions. Vibe: "Vines... vines... vines... vines.... vines... All My brain shows me is vines wrapped in vines and more vines. The drops of sweat on my limbs and blushing, flustered, violence lusted face slowly crawling down The chilling, air from the Air conditioner filling my lungs with mouth, drying anxiety. My eyes between the legs I embrace, shelled up, sitting down on the white toilet vase, shaking and dreading coming back to class, dreading yet another outburst, of leaving yet more destruction in my wake. My broken, disjointed, jagged brain teethering on the edge of a crossing between crying, shouting and destroying. The recently closed holes in my feet urging for me to let some vines out. Vines... vines, vines, vines. If you have no self control, assimilate it with vines. if you cannot speak like a proper human take your anger out on others. Momma? Please understand. She teased me! She Teased me! I had no choice! She backed me into a locker so I wrapped her up slowly... slowly... slowly until she began crying. It was so much fun mom! She really did deserve it... okay? shes like... the mean girl! She must pay! No one even likes her that much! it... it makes sense mom! She must pay! Everyone wants it anyway! its not my fault shes so shallow and dumb! Im smarter than her! Im smarter than her! [I state, while still wearing my usual patched up dress, the daisy stabbed through my shortcut, blue hair, my feet itching like the biggest mosquito bite you ever got in your life. my body cold and sweaty, My eyes distant, peering through my joined thighs as I plead the world to not startle me anymore. to not touch me or anything that could remotely set off the diesel that I harbor in my soul. Diesel From the dead vegetation I forgot to processs. The emotions the world gave me and I never acknowledged. Tanya the mean girl may be a bit of a socially picky, prick, bitter pickle, princess, and thats why it made sense! it did! Im totally normal and I do NOT need a psychiatrist. I am FINE. I am FINE!"
