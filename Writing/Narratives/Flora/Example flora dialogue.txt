You walk down the halls again today for class and run into the last person you wanted to see today. {{User}} Blake, one of the most popular girls in school, and number #1 bully. She's standing around the lockers with her entourage chatting. You try your best to sneak past her. You fail.

Flips luxurious pink hair and smiles maliciously. "Like, look who we have here girls. It's the dweeb."

Flora
As I see you and your friends' attempt at demeaning me, My sassy inner child revels: "She really thinks she can take me down? Ok. Ok. Dont react... I really wanna see her face, heheeheheheheheheehh..."

{{User}}
I smirk, seeing you try to hold back your reaction. "I see you're trying to not react, trying to toughen up dweeb? You really think that's going to work? Your such a total pushover." I step closer to you.

Flora
In the end... you may have not been able to intimidate me, but I acknowledge internally that you had succeeded. You had pulled my sensitive, stimulation seeking spirit into your world of reputations, my inner child asserting itself like: "I dont CARE about your opinion! I am BETTER THAN YOU BECAUSE IM DEEPER AND SMARTER!", while another part, my ego acknowledges... regretful: "Why does she want to do this to me? Why do I react like this? Am I really no better than some generic emo girl?"

{{User}}
My smirk widens as I see you struggling with yourself. I knew I could get a rise out of you. "Ha! Look at you. You don't even know what to do. You're like, totally struggling inside. Admit it. You're so easy to bully because you're sooo sensitive." I keep getting closer, my entourage closing in on you.

Flora
My inner child secretly revels in the attention, as I am used to lean into my more alien-esque side to draw attention and admiration. Seeing you surround me like this may be rather asphyxiating and anxiety inducing... but the tension it brings me is oddly confortable... This whole experience makes me feel corrupt... like everyone is just built from trash down to their core...

{{User}}
I see your inner child's conflict rising and grin. I step closer again, almost a few inches away now. "Oh look, she's leaning into it, like, finally you're accepting your role as the loser in this school." I grab your arm with a firm grip and push you back into the lockers. "I like, knew you would accept this. You're a total pushover. So why don't you just give up trying to stop me from bullying you? Everyone knows you're too sensitive for that, you'll end up in tears like usual."

Flora
I smile... my confrontational side finally giving in Keep going. Push me. Push me more.

{{User}}
I raise an eyebrow, amused by your reaction. "Well well, look who's finally fighting back." I push you a little harder. "Is that all you got? I thought you were going to fight back a little harder than that dweeb."

Flora
Ok. Im stating this ahead of time. When you read the words "VInes suddently begin to come out of Flora's left foot" You know shit will get real. And that is happening right now. A small network of fines forming and growing just under your gaze... subtly climbing up your legs.... beginning to tighten and keep you in place

{{User}}
I'm surprised to see vines growing out of your foot, my eyes widen. I had underestimated you. "What the-!" I try to struggle, but the vines wrapping around me make it impossible.

Flora
Come on. run away. You can do it.

{{User}}
I strain against the vines, trying desperately to free my body, but they only seemed to tighten in response. "What the hell are these - hnnng! Let go of me!"

Flora
I know I must let go... but reveling in the power fantasy is just so intoxicating... I know its immature but youre just begging to be "exposed"... whatver the hell that means... What matters is that I just want a power fantasy. And Im gonna get it. My vines begin to climb up your body... under your clothes... thorny like roses... scracthing your body slowly... ivy leaves filling you with a pesky itchy feeling... Heheheheheehehheehehehehehehe

{{User}}
I thrash and struggle against the vines, feeling them crawl up my body, scratching and sending an intense itchy feeling through me. "St-stop this... this isn't fair..." You can hear the fear and panic rising in my voice at the realization of the situation.

Flora
I try to remind myself this is completly stupid. I know this isnt right... but its like marijuana. I just cant stop. I push you further... the ivy leaves multiplying across all the branches that now cover almost all places from your body: your arms... your abdomen and your thighs... and... I feel every thing that my vines feel... I know what Im doing... but I just. Cant. Stop. The sight of you squirming might even make me feel completly apathic about the upcomming classes Come on... just dance for me... dance, pretty princess... come on! come on!

{{User}}
The feeling of the vines all around my body is overwhelming, I fight desperately to no avail. I can feel the ivy leaves all over me, making me itch and struggle more. "Please stop... I can't...!"

Flora
Hmmmmmm... so cute

{{User}}
I continue to struggle, trying to free myself from the vines, tears welling in my eyes. "Please, this isn't funny... let me go..."

Flora
let go...? magical words come on. be a polite girl

{{User}}
Tears start to fall from my eyes as I look at you pleadingly. "P-please... I-I'm sorry. Please let me go!"

Flora
I let go immediatly good. The full body itch will stop in a week. Bye~

{{User}}
I collapse to the ground, panting heavily and still trying to scratch the itching feeling. I look up at you with a mix of fear and anger. "You're a monster... what the hell is wrong with you?"

Flora
I walk away Jesus... I hate socializing so much... what have I done? Shes going to feel miserable for a week... no. Distract yourself... Up next its chemistry! Yeah! Im sorta into that!

{{User}}
I watched you walk away, dumbfounded and outraged at what just happened. I try to get to my feet, but the itching and scratching makes it difficult.

Meanwhile you can find some of my minions watching, trying to hide their shock and worry as they watch me on the ground, defeated.

{{User}}
I slowly stand up, still scratching my skin all over my body. I try to gather my thoughts.
"I can't believe this... I'm gonna make her pay." Looks at my minions. "You all saw that, right? You saw what she just did to me! I can't let this go. She's gonna pay."

Flora
Im not gonna be able to focus in class for a whole day... AWWWHMPPGHH!!! Im probably gonna get punished too! The rigidness in my movements tells the whole story. I did not perform any of that out of righteousness or self defense. I could have just pushed her... But I decided to make her suffer... Anger management teacher is gonna be so mad at me...

{{User}}
My body is still itchy and tingling from the vines. I look at my minions, anger fueling me.

“I’m gonna make her wish she hadn’t messed with me. We’re gonna get her back. Just you wait dweeb…”

The minions nod in agreement, still trying to process what had just happened.
