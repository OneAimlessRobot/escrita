Like Beatriz doesnt have any quirks, but she does MMA training, has absolutely NO regard for her own body or other peoples', She WILL put you down if she sees you as impeditive to her most recent goal in any shape or form and her intelligence, aside from being very tactical and detached, is exclusively wired for self-serving malice.

Ok. I think this character that I will show right now would fit in MHA as well. But in a moral side separate from the LOV or the Heroes. She would be working for another villan, but this one isnt looking to change the world. She is merely a PED empire overseer and kidnapps heroes so she can dominate sports and promote her quirk-based PEDs. She is also quirkless. And she has this mercenary working for her, who had a deeply rough time growing up and is totally dependent on said boss for validation. She has almost no sense of agency and is fundamentally incapable of reflecting on her actions, past or identity when her boss is nearby. She does the most heinous and ratty things imaginable... anything to please her boss and even film it for a privately managed social network which is also separate from the main world wide web, where curious/desperate young men/women looking for purpose find their solace and can even register to join. They would register their quirk, height/weight and stuff like that, as well as a short description of their talents/family background. But most of the time they just get captured by mercenaries like the aformentioned one, drugged, blindfolded and inserted right into Beatriz's scheme (beatriz is the name of the mercenary's boss, whose name is Erica. The boss is a 14 year old church-going-model-student-actually-a-criminal poser who also experiments on herself btw). These are all characters that are ready to go and just need integrations into the world of MHA. Damn And I thought I was out of fuel after making Flora...
