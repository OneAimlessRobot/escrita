So... Caleb ends up enrolled in Yuuei High School, the same school as Izuko Midorya. he has a past of bullying. The quirk he was born with, Agro, Essentially removes his "emotional limiter", meaning that, for example, he can get indefinitely angry, indefinitely sad and feel indefinite ammounts of regret. His emotions also stack so he can feel various emotions simulatenously. he works hard, is curious, creative and with an eye for a good approach for a problem. But... he has a bit of a reputation for being a bit of a "trouble maker-weirdo hybrid". During his first year of elemetary school he was obcessed with Pro Wrestling, and always tried to get involved in fights with other students just to experiment with Pro Wrestling moves in real life. (Aka he is like a WWE weirdo). Also... he was born with borderline personality disorder, (A diagnosis he obtained because of his quirk), which makes him flare up at nothing and forgive and tolerate very little. During his first year of elementary school, he got involved in loads of fights, mainly from his own doing and agency, and his peers began initially treating him as some sort of boogeyman. So he became... respected... (?) all around the school premises and teachers were wary of having him inserted into their classes. But soon enough, his peers began a sort of "Revolution" against him, starting a conspiracy that would effectively isolate him from any form of meaningful friendships he could have during his formative years. He was(is) easly teasable, a party pooper and displays very odd behaviour outside of his heightened state. He play(s)ed niche videogames, and, after being effectively condemned to indefinite exile, he fell into indefinite loneliness.
He began getting paranoid, "Overhearing" mockery behind his back that wasnt there, began developing a "Persecution", "me vs them" mentality and became spiteful and distrusting of formal and even legal systems... as he headbutted policemen in the street, pissed in trees in parks and almost everything he did was out of spite. That reflected in his school work. Despite being very often caught engaged in high level literary activites at the library, he often scored the bare minimum in classes like english, despite his love for looking up "Super Extreme Animals" on google, he scrapped by his natural science classes and... needed an actual teacher to help him during his math tests. yes. he needed help *during* tests. the latter situation angrying him out even more. And, for some reason, maybe due to the constant teasing or subtly developing masochistic tendencies, whenever he hung out with ANYONE, he ALWAYS hung out with the most untrustworthy/teasing people he could possibly find. And his interactions always looked like his peers telling him seemingly normal things that anyone could see (Your eyes are red) (You are short) (Your shirt is blue) but he was just so enabled and his reactionary attitude was so grooved in, that he ALWAYS flared up. ALWAYS. he could not stop flaring up. And, during quirk activities, he NEVER participated. he either deliberately quit, Did it half way and then went home BY HIMSELF, WITHOUT EVEN WAITING FOR HIS PARENTS, or, he was in class, nothing was happening but he just... decided to leave. Just like that...
Some troubling concrete examples of his interactions in his middle school and late elementary school journeys include:
*Not showing up to class after a dentist appointment in the day*
*Shows up the next day*
The teacher: "Wow... you here again?" *Turns her head to class* "Kids look at this! look at what god brought me here! *Sigh...* They should raise a statue in my honour because of ME!"

Another:
*getting ready for high school admission exams*
One of his actual peers: "Hey you! I hope you fail! Please fail!"

Another:
*Caleb's 12th birthday in middleschool*
A peer goes up to him, spitefully kneels down... and begins mock-begging: "Please change... we cant stand you. Please change now. Please. Do it for us. Do it for humanity"

Appearance:

He is short, standing at about 1.65m tall, weighs 65 kilograms, as his quirk, because of the hormonal supercharging it provides, makes his muscles grow with WAY less conscious effort than average. His built, although strong, is somewhat thin. Displays red, short hair, messy hair, red eyes and a resting serious expression. He has a "Jonhy Test"-esque way of speaking, mirroring what I best describe as "90's 12 year old"

Never had that feeling of people saying stuff *Just* to tease you and, even though you know that its all completly baseless, you *still* get reeled in and start doubting yourself? Caleb is the embodyment of that

But... now his middle school days are over and... luckly, in this new school (Deku's school) Most people in this new school (Except Mineta, of course, whom he would, oddly, likely befriend.) are mature and dont really give a damn about frivolous teasing, which could, ironically, spiral him further into teasing tendencies... projecting his fears into everyone he sees or gets approached by, leading to isolation and underperforming. His best asset is his anger driven strength boosts... but, tragically, in a quirk-beats-quirk world, he will likely not succeed, as his current, specific anger doesnt pack a punch. its cynical, doubtful and wary. Its spiteful and shallow. Resentful and, because his actual environment is different now, Almost completly baseless.

During his first year, before the sports festival, the laser crotch guy (forgot his name) organized a conspiracy... although based in nothing but clever lies, that would make every student refuse to fight him... forcing him to fight actual heroes in the pro teachers. His first opponent is midnight. This is how I think it would go:
Caleb... grouchy look on face... staring at nothing... grumbling... tapping his foot on the floor, crossed arms and tapping finger on the bicep: "..."
Midnight: "Whats wrong, sweetie? Dont wanna fight huh?~" *her sultry teasing is her weapon... but Caleb dont wanna fight no one right now... as he... hates it, having joined this school reluctantly because his parents, perceptively, believed that children who had chosen willingly to fight, would be too mature and adversity molded to try and tease him... which was true... but its... *sigh..* not really working, unfortunately*
Caleb: "look. Miss... I barely have any fighting skill. I skipped all the drills, I skippd all the classes... and Now I need to fight an actual Pro Hero? Huh? How is that fair?! Im walking OUT OF HERE!" *Looks at audience... and with his deepest anger and loudest shout hes ever uttered, he yells with deafening intensity* "IIIII HAAAAATTTTE ALLLL OFF YOUUUUUUUUU!!!!!" *Stomps the ground, cracking the arena a bit... his actual skin steaming, as his internal body temperature is at about 56ÂºC. Begins walking out the the arena... so he loses on purpose... skipping over the ledge... leaving the arena*
Midnight... speechless: "What... how could the system have failed him... this badly... *Sigh...*"
