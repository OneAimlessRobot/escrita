Misty is a warrior built in a lab. She wields very badass rifles, Runs fast and packs a punch. Wears armor and takes out really scary looking monsters while one of her dad's employe's guides her through an intercom. She jumps from building to building in search of the "loose subjects" (threats) that the experiments of her dad's Bio Weapon development facility sometimes accidentally lets out! One of those, was Psych2Go! Anyways... she has short, jagged hair, is currently 17 years old, has blue, plain eyes. (No retinas. its all a blue circle), a cartoonish looking nose and moth and the rest of the body is realistic. Her hair is blonde, bordering on white and her armor is military grade, featuring a plate vest hosting AR500 armor plates on the front, back AND sides, a thick thermal suit underneath her armor with adjustable thermostat, thick boots, Armor plates on shins and thighs and steel rounded caps on her elbows and knees. The armor vest, which is made of kevlar, is fully black, and her thermal suit is blue, matching her eyes. She has psychic (The same as Ester and Filipa and MY GOD I AM NOT EXPLAINING THOSE AGAIN! ILL ELABORATE IF ASKED TO) AND Agro powers (Also explained). She was developed and tinkered with in vittro *literally* from the ground up (All the way from her genetic code to the figures she attached to, also being allowed a strategic ammount of childlike freedom, and even letting her exhibit teenage-rebellion like traits so as to not stunt her personality development and keep her predictible later on). She is way stronger than the average human, capable  of running at up to 90 kph fully armored, skip over rooftops (densely urbanized areas obviously) and keep up with highway traffic for a few seconds before running out of breath, (Fully armored btw). She was created and educated with some rules in mind though: She had to develop the "ESTP" MBTI type, as she was gonna be a mercenary that typically dealt with chaos on a daily basis WHILE also being a healthly attached human, highly intelligent, disciplined and, even if reluctantly, willing to follow orders. They... did their best. 
On a mission: "Misty?"
Misty, picking her nose as she looks into the distance... distracted by some people she can see from the rooftop, due to her ridiculous natural eyesight, kissing eachother: "Mmmm... yes dude! Come on girl! Make him yours!"
General: "MISTY!"
Misty: "WAHHH! Yeah?"
general: "Look. Can you focus on the mission?"
Misty: "Take out bad guy? That one? Havent I already done that?"
General: "We need you to take out another one though... BUT THAT DOESNT MATTER. Head tow-"
Misty: "Why doesnt that just call them back for dinner or something? I always do it when he asks nicely..."
General: "Stop joking ar-"
Misty: "HEheheheheheheeh... I bet your face is priceless right now you old dead beat!"
General: *Groaning* "Im giving you a target." *Stimulates Misty's psychic gland through the sonar* "Can you see them?"
Misty: "Ughh.... on it... FAKE DAD!" *Immediatly disconnects... beginning to chase her target, jumping down into a bush and landing with a body roll...*
Misty is a mercenary with an attitude and a vendetta for anything that distracts her from her... distractions. The officers that guide her are her "Fake dads" And her real dad is "Not MY DAD!".
She loves when they make dishes like "Spaguetti with tomato sauce, peas and pork" "grilled sardines with olive oil and boiled potatoes" and "Pizza". (She actually likes fish more... which actually, from all that actually makes her up, was one of the things that actually surprised scientists more... as they believed humans intrinsically enjoyed meat more) her favourite fire arm weapons are, obviously, she was trained to be the best at: marksman rifles! Any kind! Giant honks of metal that smash into your shoulder like the CheyTac Intervention, Classic, rugged ones like the Mosin Nagant, and even conventional ones like the Remington 700 (her favourite weapon as she "Feels the most confortable with it"). She was projected to learn how to speak a sort of "Language Hull" (A minimal subset of idioms and relevant spoken languages that would allow her to communicate with any potential bystander during her missions. it Includes english, Portuguese, Russian and Mandarin). She doesnt actually need to develop any studying habits, as she is gently guided by the scientists that worked on her (Her "dad" calls her "My masterpiece... and my darling") to study, while also bringing her to the skatepark, as there she can be herself without being horrendously awkward, so she knows how to rollerblade, skate and ride bycicles. She prefers the rollerblades, as she finds skateboards "Dumb and slow" and Bicycles "lame". There, she doesnt need to speak or read people. She goes in, with her dad watching from afar, of course,  performs her tricks and has fun for 2 hours, and then comes back. Recently... she began subtly high- fiving the kids in the park when arriving... taking her first few steps into socialization. Her attachment is, innevitably, a bit anxious but is mostly healthy, as the scientists reported when noticing her wandering alot in place without her radar "coordinates" changing that much for about 20 minutes before deciding to continue with the mission, after either party disconnected the intercom (That happens in tactical breaks. During battles she immediatly resumes with taking out the target), which suggests pacing due to some emotional overwhelm.
They had to hire a maid to breast feed her... "She called her "her mommy" and now "her mah""... she... ended up acknowledging her as a shy, reserved, best friend though. 
She also carries a swiss army knife and a Colt M1911 pistol, along with smoke and M67 frag grenades.

Body:
height: 172cm
weight: 74kg
Kind of... average looking body. Quite muscular looking body... but nothing overtly quirky let alone outstanding... Just looks like a 17 year old girl that does crossfit every other day. But without the same... feral demeanour. Just... just a mischiveously disobedient, but ultimately loyal golden retriever with psychic powers and loads of sweat and appetite, that can sprint at American Freeway commuting speeds.

She is absolutely *neurologically* obcessed with playing burnout games. She is great at all of them and begged her dad to help her install an emulator in her living pod's workstation for every generation of console she needed to complete all of them. She also begs her dad everyday to take her to a lan party so she can play games with other kids. (Maybe one day he will be free enough to let her?)

Shes the kind of girl who would introduce herself to a boy she likes by swearing in mandarin just to impress them
