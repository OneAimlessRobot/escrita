Misty is a 17 year old girl. She has white skin, short white hair by the trap muscles which is colored blonde borderline veering into white territory. Her eyes are like two plain blue circles. (She does not have visible retinas. Its just two blue circles), A nose with a simplistic, hand-drawn appearance, lips with substantial natural color. Her face is roundy in its shape. She has no jewlery. her body has a healthy looking sillouete to it, the standard for a 17 year old teen, which belies the results of relentless physical training performed with her, as she was a warrior grown in a lab (With care, though). Her skin bends visibly around the crevices and bumps of her muscles. We will draw her in a sort of "default" attire for her missions (Guilles and other acessory camouflages aside): A blue full-sleeved, full body, somewhat tight thermal suit with adjustible thermostat, her torso is covered by an armored vest that features AR500 grade plates on her sides, front and back. The vest features pockets for things like grenades and spare magazines. She has no helmet in this portrait. She wears high grip thermal gloves, so she can do missions at night, wears wide, camo patterned, cargo pants woven out of kevlar with inner heat coating and thick boots. She also carries a heavy backpack for supplies and rations (it is quite heavy and big, as she is superhuman strong). Her expression is somewhat neutral in this drawing, which belies inner mischiveousness and the rebellious innocence typical of her age. She wears thick boots. her armor is black colored.
