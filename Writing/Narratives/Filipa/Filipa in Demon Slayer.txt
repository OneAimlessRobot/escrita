*so... the insect obcessed, nerdy, fake smiling, feeling repressing, blue haired girl from the hashibra's who fans really like to ship for some reason was on the prowl for some dangerous and hard enemies to kill. On her way to collect ingredients for her dru- I mean combat poisons, she encoutered Filipa, our actual and actually deserving and truest of the true main character: Filipa! Filipa was just grooving to her own train track. Freestyling with her metal, wysteria coated ball and talking shit to random passerby's that already knew her. She is a demon than is currently living off blood "donations" (pathetic  door-to-door begging) from locals in cities she passes by. She gathers people around (Not using force though. She prefers social skill actually) and the performs a soccer freestyling show using her enigmatic metal ball and her huge legs to express herself. Then... as she cleverly has not announced a request for a reward yet, she then cheekly asks for each individual person in the crowd to slit any part of their bodies slightly so she can gather it all around in a vase to drink it! yes... this is how she eats. And she continuously trains, and hard, so she can juggle better, run faster from demons trying to convert her to Muzan's ways and, of course, to defeat cocky hashibras in endurance foot racing in challenges she proposes to them when they first try to kill her. "hey bro bro bro! chill! chill! Whats your sprint time?" She has mild psychic powers but the most impressive thing about her... is how HARD and HOW LONG she can both jump, skip around, run, jog and... most importantly, K I C K. She can kick that metal ball she wields at all times at about 200 mph peak!

She recently got adopted by the Hashibras as a "Pet", so she can have chaotic edge to her personality honed into a refined blade (pun intended) and craft her own battle style. They feed her blood bags donated by people that help keep benevolent demons like Filipa alive and kicking! Filipa loves to tease Sanemi who constantly threatens to kill her (albeit he doesnt really mean to) while having nuanced yapping sessions with the pink bimbo and the airheaded mist guy. her "cancer daddy" also puts her in specially brutal (yet tailored and effective) mental training. She is asked to meditate for 1 hour a day... and from *scratch*, while having what essentially is lifetime-undiagnosed-and-severe ADHD mixed with some Bipolar disorder. As a life overwhelmingly dominated by chaos has left her with no sense of (and sometimes disinterest in) grounding herself in the present, always adapting and always moving. She is quick witted, good at adaptible, real time problem solving and *loves* soccer. (Soccer is like yugiohh for USA in taisho era japan at this time due to how utterly niche it is at this point in human history... like... very, very niche swordsmanship mixed with weird rules and "why cant you just use your hands? Its impressive but... alright nevermind I like it"). She trolls hashibras, tries to get nezuko out of her box to play at night (Filipa was found after Tanjiro fought spider boy) in the hashibra base of operations and she is scared shitless of Doma, who she saw one time and then ran away from like the plague.


She is not that empathetic. She has this sorta well meaning and kind "just do what I did! Its easy bro!" Sorta approach to giving advice that hits hard whenever it does and not at all when... it doesnt.

(Low effort back story: She got r-worded by muzan at age 10, along with her parents, who did not survive the alterc8ion, ended up running away, after consuming from her parents and storing some for later. She then found a blacksmith guy who she wanted to learn from despite being a demon. She ate her blood in secrecy, away from her blacksmithing mentor, while also going out for more when he wasnt looking, often by... uhh... offering her cheeks... and, as she was good at juggling stuff with her feet when she was young (A talent she thought was completly useless), she began asking the man to smelt metal balls for her, which were also coated in wysteria. As she did not want to raise suspiscion, that is also how she learned how to time her juggling in precise ways so she did not get hurt by the dreaded plant. She also found out that her attractive body was gonna be an advantage, and frequently used it to get what she needed (Although not in malice, but in self-interested resourcefulness, like seducing locals for blood left-overs. She spent 10 years surviving of blood left overs because she never bothered to ask anyone if there were donations for demons, as she, the girl who whored herself for blood, as a demon, thought that blood donations for demons were "too taboo". The absurdity of this girl is unmatched). Also... she once also was carried to the sea, to meet portuguese discovery age sailors as she was... *ahem* a... feminine... professional, bedroom partner for most of her life, (while she did not realize she could show off her odd juggling skills for blood too), and the allure of a... *ahem* girl who was paid in blood kept the tired, traumatized, hungry and homesick sailors entertained and endlessly fascinated. She also learned that her talent was not completly useless. Luis Vaz De Cam√µes told her that the English, another group of folk from a country that was also very far away from Japan, had this thing called "Soccer", and then that was when Filipa knew all about it! She quit being a hooker and became a professional Foot Juggler!)
Her approach to fighting is... interesting. For her, the fight begins far, far before the two forces even meet on the field. (She also only fights at night for... obvious reasons. And before she got wysteria proof clothing, for which the recipie is highly disclosed as, in a world curently dominated by Muzan, every wall has ears, she needed to have the proper timing to kick the wysteria coated ball. But now she has got proper fabric pants and she can kick it without fear anymore! she currently has killed 2 evil demons and has helped the hashibras bring in 1 innocent one! (im not talking about him)
Anyways... she pulls up at the moment she feels the vibe is the most favorable, and then, while everyone, including teamates, who never expect her to show up at the times she does, somehow, is absolutely "quaking in their boots" (her words), she kicks the ball at the meanest looking guy, she begins juggling and freestyling with the ball for the whole battlefield, doing 'round the worlds, penguins (she invented it), switch-backs and other kinds of airtricks and shit... holding up to her... *ahem* big tatas... and shit... before setting it up  with some kick ups and knee ups for a powerful volley that she can regularly shoot at up to 120 MPH (Its a 100 kg 15cm radius, steel sphrere by the way. Oh! and she was also logged as able to maintain an on-foot pace of 60 kph for up to 5 miles. And kick old, alive oak trees down with running kicks!) at the meanest looking guy she finds (she probably wont get that ball back any time soon btw... as it often is going so fucking fast and it is so fucking heavy it just goes deep underground) For her, "the spectacle is totally worth it" though. She then drops from where she pulled up (usually some vantage point at a good height) AND after the ocasionally occuring but never underappreciated "Titflash" at the whole battalion and enemy combatants alike, uttering the words: "LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, NERDS?",  drop kicks said meanest-looking-guy-in-the-frey. (She once almost decapitated Sanemi with her ball and also began kicking the shit out of him mid battle. Tanjiro had to threaten to kill Filipa before she locked in and actually went for the Demon they were suposed to kill)
