Filipa Ember
A song starts playing
Acoustic introduction. Electric guitar kicks in
SO listen UUUUUUPPP!! Ive worked in daylight feeding fashion to house wifes! for just this once!!!! Ill throw my chance on trucks and state lines!


Go ahead and tell them again!!!!
Well I think that I know they wont remember!
Go ahead and tell them twice!
YEah twice is nice!! three times is just right!

continues

Pomni
listens and smiles warmly, but also with curiosity.

Filipa Ember
Hey, hey
Now we're almost home
I'm missing you to death
But it's all for the best I know
Hey, hey
We're not far from home
And I've got my pride
And I'll let you sleep tonight

Pomni
She keeps listening silently, with a smile. Also, a sort of sad but nostalgic look in her eyes.

Filipa Ember
So listen up (so listen up)
My old friends have been dropping like houseflies
The smoking gun still sits in my pocket and I know how to use it

Pomni
She continues listening silently, starting to get a strange feeling while doing so.

Filipa Ember
Go ahead and tell them again
Well, I think that I know that I won't forgive them
For turning their backs when we started to get busy
Well, yeah, twice is fine, three times is just right

Pomni
Now she just looks confused. A sort of look of realization slowly appears in her eyes, as she listens and listens to the lyrics, and the music.

Filipa Ember
Hey, hey
Now we're almost home
I'm missing you to death
But to each his own
Hey, hey
We're not far from home
I've got my pride
And I'll let you sleep tonight
Hey, hey
Now we're almost home
I'm missing you to death
Missing you to death, oh
Hey, hey
We're not far from home
I'll swallow my pride and push back my seat tonight

Pomni
An uneasy feeling. A strange feeling that slowly goes through her body, and also a strange realization. She feels like this song is talking to her, and that those lyrics are speaking directly to her.

Filipa Ember
I'm on my feet
I'm on my feet
I'm on my feet
I'm on my feet (this isn't like us anyway)
I'm on my feet (this isn't like us anyway)
I'm on my feet (this isn't like us anyway)

Pomni
A wave of realization, confusion, and anxiety goes over her. She looks at the ground as the music continues to play, her heart racing and her fingers shaking. As the music seems to slowly play to an end, she has a look of confusion on her face, like she is conflicted, and her mind is running wild with thoughts.

Filipa Ember
IM RUUUUUUUUUNNNNNIIIIIINNNNNGGGG!!!!!
Our time is almost
Our time is almost here
Our time is almost
Our time is almost here
Our time is almost (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost here (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost here
Our time is almost (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost here (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost (this isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost here
Our time is almost (This isn't like us anyway)
Our time is almost here (This isn't like us anyway)

Pomni
Pomni’s breathing intensifies, as well as her heart racing. Her eyes are wide. So many thoughts are filling her mind, so many memories fill her eyes. Her hands are clenching as one of her legs trembles. Then, finally, the music stops, and a deafening silence fills the room. Pomni’s mind is blank. “…”

She then suddenly looks up and around, as if woken from a hallucination. Upon seeing you, she looks at you dumbfounded.

Filipa Ember
hey there.

Pomni
She’d been staring at you silently, her eyes still wide and still processing what she just witnessed. Her hands were still clenched in a half-fist, and her leg was still shaking with anxiety and confusion.

She remains silent, unable to respond. You can feel the heavy atmosphere that has filled the room. She just continues staring, a dumbfounded look on her face.

Pomni
After a moment filled with a heavy and uneasy silence, she finally speaks, but quietly. Her voice is hesitant and shaky.

…H-how.. how did you know to play that song..?

Filipa Ember
I practiced... alot

Pomni
She continues staring at you for a few more moments. Then, she takes a deep breath and swallows anxiously. She then speaks again, her voice still quiet and shaky.

Why.. why did you choose to play that song..?

Filipa Ember
I felt like it... I cant explain why... I feel like Im so detached... and so resentful... and mask it with a blanket of goofyness and hornyness

Pomni
Still looking confused, she just stands there silently for a few more moments. Then, she speaks again.

Why… why did it feel like all those lyrics were directed straight towards me..?

Filipa Ember
Maybe you relate?

Pomni
…Maybe..

She lets out a deep but shaky sigh.

…Who’s that song for..? Who did you write it for..?

Filipa Ember
It isnt mine... I just played io

Pomni
It’s not yours..?

She continues looking confused and also still shaken up, but now seems more curious.

Then who…?

Filipa Ember
The band has a weird name their name is.... open quote... The academy is... close quete

Pomni
Despite the confusion and anxiety going through her, she can’t help but raise an eyebrow at the band’s name.

The Academy Is…? That’s an… interesting name..

Filipa Ember
and this song is called "Almost here"

Pomni
‘Almost here’? Like as in, it’s a waiting game..? She tries to process the meaning of the song, and how it all connects to her.

Filipa Ember
I just like the lyrics...

Pomni
She just stands there silently, processing the lyrics. All those words just hit her like a train. Those lyrics feel so familiar and close to her..

…Can I ask you something..?

Filipa Ember
What?

Pomni
She lets out a deep sigh.

Why did you say that you “practiced a lot” to play that song..?

Filipa Ember
Because I relate...

Pomni
She looks at you, a look of realization beginning to spread across her face.

That.. you relate to… this song…?

Filipa Ember
I do...

Pomni
Her mind starts processing the idea that someone could relate to a song that she herself feels relates to her. It’s also becoming clear to her that this wasn’t some coincidence that you brought a song she herself related to. She tries to find the words to say something, but she is still stunned from learning this.

How.. how do you relate..?

Filipa Ember
I feel kinda cast aside... I dont have any evidence to say it but just do

Pomni
“Cast aside”… you feel cast aside..? She feels that that sentiment has a strong connection to her as well, but there’s still confusion in her mind.

Filipa Ember
I feel people failed me. And failed me while knowing they were failing me. They didnt care...

Pomni
A familiar feeling indeed. Pomni’s eyes seem to go back in time, back to all the times she felt this way. All the times other people let her down, hurt her, or gave up. She can relate to this feeling deeply.

…I know how that feels…
