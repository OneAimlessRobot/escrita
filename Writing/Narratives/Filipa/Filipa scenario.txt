there was also this one time where she was fighting muzan, on some Resident Evil 3 nemesis encounter type shit, and they start fighting right? And at this point, like always, the objective for our girlie Pippa (nickname), was to run away right? So she is trying to dodge his shit... having already lost a hand, that she could not catch enough of a break to heal back... so she began asking questions... her brain on pure absurd fantasy survival mode. She notices Muzan Jump really high to try and catch her once again and she just hits him with this: "Hey! Muzz Man!"
*He replies as he lands right in front of her... blocking her escape route* "Yes, you ***re?"
Pippa girlie: "Nothing, actually..:"
Muzz: "Wh- what?" *He stops*
*Filipa performs the same tactic yet again.... opening her shoulder slightly and shoving her hands down looking into his chest with her eyes looking down...*
"Calm down bro! lets chilll... Come on! Lets chill ok bro? Not. Cool! Aight? Ok. Ok hear me out now: What if... ok? W- What if..."
*Muzan keeps striking her, she barely dodges again... but gets severely gashed in her abdomen* GAHHH!!!! YOU F- *Heals it out quickly... taking a deep breath... running away again... asking as she absolutely puts the pedal to the mud! OMFG LOOK AT HER GO! SOMEONE PASS HER A TICKET MY GOD! SHE LOWKEY DISOBEYING EVERY SINGLE NATURE LAW OF TRAFFIC! BITCH THESE AINT THE WOOUTOBAHNS!*
"What IFFFF!!! HEAR ME! STOP!" *Dodges another spike  which was aimed at her femur artery*
"WHAT IF, EVERYTIME YOU JUMP, 50% of the TIME, YOU THINK YOU LANDED, BUT ACTUALLY DIDNT?"
Muzan: "What?" *Stops attacking* "What the hell does that mean?"
"Ok..." *Sigh...* *Hehe... hehe... hah... hah... hah...* *Laughing and panting in sheer panic... trying her absolute hardest to remain patient and coolheaded*
"What if everytime you jumped, there were times where you land... but instead of landing you fall on your face and your brain keeps dreaming..."
*Filipa begins signaling a Hashibra to come help her using her atrophied-from-lack-of-usage psychic powers. Her eyes glowing green. Yet Muzan keeps listening, amused... convinced he has where he wants me... not actually aware of my psychic powers at this point... which I actually had before he turned me into a demon*
Muzan: "Ok and? What then?" *He asks... with a hint of impatience mixed with curiosity and eagerness*
Pippa, our girlie: "Like right? And then you live a completly paralel alternative life, but your body is just flat ass on the ground?"
