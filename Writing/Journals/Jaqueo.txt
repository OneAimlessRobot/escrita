Ideas:


Find your castle in the sky. No one knows where it hides. Standing, floating above the surface in a huge island. Everything can be what you want it to be... inside your fortress of safety. Surrounded by clouds and cold air, your fantasies become palpable. Your logic becomes more self, the same logic that what makes you who you are... That you stubburnly hold on to. Your authenticity bubble will shrink... and densen up... after youve finally reached into the farthest corners of the earth... by consuming everything inside... all the emotions, people youve known and sights youve beheld... until youve absorbed all the strength your environment can give you. Then... you will become a survivor of the social tides... an explorer... as you let your own tape recording soul fetch on and observe the world... with a keen eye and subtle presence. Your fingers point at the mundane... trying to pierce through and reaching for something deeper... The vibes that flee and escape, those... well... you seek to ground them in real objects for you to play with... until the next vibe comes. For you whats already created is boring. Whats to be created is whats trully important."What could I create now?" Is the question you ask. From the top of the tallest tower of your castle... you watch in conformity... as your loved ones and the curious try to reach to you... to connect, to understand. You refuse to let them in... as you justify your neglect with their struggle... "They will never get me. I dont care how this comes across... Im just, whatever this sounds like... too... far away... to atomized... too... different." creating a cycle of selfishness... As you grow more and more lonely... your words of invalidation... of incompetence... pierce through them... making some of them give up, rocking the more determined... The empaths struggling to reach every corner on earth... just to find out... you might just not be worth all the struggle... so you isolate yourself within your pillow fort... ever strong and ever standing... ever old and reliable... trying to focus... with all the push and pull of conformity and individuality happening... threatning to cause its implosion. Focusing on whats between the lines, as a poet and carving your fascination into eye catching toys as an artist, your evergoing struggle to turn your inner worlds into something visible rages on... so that, when other people are finally able to see what you contain inside... after all the vague and all the metaphorical give away to the concrete and clear... and your sense of innadequacy one day wears off... so you can finally let your loved ones... inside your castle... in the sky. After that... whats left is for you to take their hands... so they can help you merge, including yours, all of earths internal realms... making the world... more welcoming.



"What, Tomoko? A prodigy? A footballer? Advice? From me? Little, little Tomoko... I am not a footballer! I am not even an athlete! I cant run for crap! I just know where I need to be! I am a leach! A trickster that only cares about survival and licking the blood from the enemies wounds! I simply... survive. I am not a footballer... I just... am."


"In life... I find myself barely surviving... time and time again... But I enjoy it. I may not hit that hard... but I dodge almost everything too"

" Uhhh... I dont know... I always feel... empty... I dont really know... Like... all the time... I think I know always when to insert myself into... but dont know what goes... inside... I dont know... what I am owed... from life..."
"Love? Sucess? Respect? Reputation? Yeah! I obviously need those... but... there is always a puzzle piece missing... there is always a piece missing... I dont know! I think you can help me out... I think..."
" In class... when there is too much noise... I tell the teacher i need a bathroom break... but... i n reality I just go there to rest until class is over... relax? No... but I can... untension... I hide there... because its quiet... and if people see me there I can explain a little easier..."

Mafalda: "Yes... his personality architecture is very similar to mine. He is fodder when it comes to anything involving any kind of combination of feet or balls though..." Filipa: "But you approached him and spoke about shoving away attackers" Mafalda: "Yeah... he is very anxious and perfectionistic... and gives up at any self perceived mistake... But his stealth cloak style of playing is his trademark. He does not know how to lead a defense line, he does not know how to receive orders... he is just good at being invisible... But he is very good at being invisible... being near him is like being near a white hole... you just cannot seem to approach his exact location no matter what you do... he uses players around him... he is resourceful... he is smart. he is got 2nd tier soccer level game sense... at 5th tier level... he could be playing for the Gil Vicente seniors! But he is playing with us... Also... his touch is terrible... but... his ability to consume the vibe of the game instantly makes him a perfect barometer players can look at... if he looks jumpy and is running around... the team he is surrounded by better watch out... if he is relaxed... they can push... Also... he is very unpredictible... and a concrete example of his brilliance is how much his opponents find it difficult to win a confrontation with him without simply resorting to back passing... He is very small... yet not afraid of physicality. He is a genius... and... even rarer... a martyr genius. Mentor him on first touch skills and second touch passing and hes brilliant!"



In his dreams... the devil once tried to persuade him: "Listen... Jaqueo. How are you my child? Dont you feel... frail? Weak? Like you could just... snap? Break? Bleeding all around... itchy, scratchy, armory wounds... poetry in your winces in pain as your simple clothes rub against them... All the missed understanding from others... all the mocking! you know its true! its true! its true! its true! its true!.... Dont you feel like... the world is trying to make you fail? Like its trying to starve you? like its trying to submit you? Why have you neglected me for so long? You must listen! Listen! Listen! HEY! LISTEN!" Then... he wakes up and mutters: "No.... No.... I need... other people. Other people need me. I need to... fit in."
