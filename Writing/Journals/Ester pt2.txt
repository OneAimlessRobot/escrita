Ester diary pt2




*Moment of Ester*
"
*In the middle of a 2 person convo where Ester just mentioned she goes to the gym often*

Person: Really? It does not look like it... If I saw you and spoke to you for a few seconds I would have gotten the impression you dont really care about sports... or that you play chess and like to just pull strings around... Youre not even that fa-

Ester: Be quiet. Be quiet, ok? *sigh...* want me to show you something? Touch my arm. Come on. No strings attached... Im not gonna hurt you ok? *speaks in a calm, eeriely soothing voice... I swear she could not look more suspiscious than this*

Person: *nervous* Oh....ok then... *starts touching Esters pettite arm. Its... hard like nails* wow... what is this?

Ester: *Holding back a primal scream... speaking in a tepid, soothing tone with an empty expression* See? I do go. I do have muscle... wanna know more? They havent grown in a whole year... and ive been brainstorming, researching and taking advice on how to get bigger since I started. Then... I decided to ask my nutricionist: "What is happening? Why am I not growing anymore?"
They replied: "Honestly... I am just as surprised as you are... we have no idea..."
I said: "Nutricionist? What if I took....steroids? like....tons of them? *suddently screams* TO MAKE MY DEMONS GO AWAY! *returns to previous tone* what about that?"

They said: "I personally would not,Ms Ester. Id also be thankful. Your skeleton is very frail *Ester represses an offended grunt* and... if your muscles grow any bigger, they could... snap every bone in your body. *Ester... goes pale...*"

Ester: And thats basically it, Tomoko... *Sits on the ground... rather abruptly... with a sigh... starts looking down, clenching fists... shaking with anger... yet maintains composure otherwise* M- My m- muscles... d- dont grow... other wise I can die... I can die tomoko... and there is no d- drug... that can s- save me..."


"...Yes... Why do I hate myself? Simple: Because I am a worm the life of which the universe keeps on sparing. A deathless, ratty, cheating, judgemental, silly in the head parasite. But ive learned that... if life wants me to keep going so bad... maybe there is a reason. Maybe there is friends, passions, duties and experiences the world still wants me to have. So... my motivation to life is just: "Ok then. Show me."
I am Ester Glacier, the rotten tumor from Leira. I am a ratty, sly parasite. A scumbag that cheats the death she is owed. But... I am deathless. So... I must stay.

*author notes*

Ester is basically R-rated Taiga Aisaka from the Toradora anime show

Both are smol... but... whereas Taiga has 'smol boobies', Ester has 'xylophone ribs'

Also... recently... shes been having occasionall episodes of HEAVY porn usage


(Ester the choleric nature, grumpy psychic grouch)

(She did not get any trauma. She IS the trauma)

*Ester talking to a prototypical, anime INTJ run-of-the-mill character*
INTJ: omg my life was so traumatic and I had so much trauma... I feel so bad...
Ester: *Snorts* Bro U a BITCH! I AM the motherfudging trauma!


(I also like how she.... tries at sense of humor (Ni personalized understanding + Fi lack of touch with external social harmony))
