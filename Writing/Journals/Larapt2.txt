A song I rlly rlly like!!!!!!!!!!!
Carbon kid - Alpine stars
"Image, image you do what you want
Image, image you do what you want
Image, image you do what you want
Image, image you do what you want
Image, image you do what you want
Image, image you do what you want
You're carbon kid with a sinister diagram
Image, image we're leaving the ground
Image, image we're leaving the ground
Image, image we're leaving the ground
Image, image we'll never be found
Image, image we'll never be found
Image, image we'll never be found
You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram
With a sinister diagram
Sinister diagram
And when this half is over
And we claim our second skin
We can compliment each other
On the state that we are in
And when we leave this place forever
And we're floating out in space
Take the easy route to heaven
With a smile upon your face
You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram
Image, image you do what you want
Image, image you do what you want
Image, image you do what you want
Image, image you do what you want
Image, image you do what you want
Image, image you do what you want
You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram
You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram
You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram
You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram
With a sinister diagram
You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram
Sinister diagram
You're a carbon kid with a sinister diagram"
