Komaks tombstone memorial goes here


*A moment of a frame she played against Ricky Walden, where both were toe to toe throughout. And... it being Ricky Walden, it quickly coalesced into an ice cold, slow and dreaded tactical battle. At this point, an Immature Komak would have expediciously delved into despair, as she is, as one can tell, even some perceptive beginners, that she is a primarly offensive player. She hates waiting and she hates thinking with no movement. She is eager, driven and direct. Loathes having to play mindgames. But... a victory, that she got, by beating Walden 5 to 2, in a best of 9 qualifying round, would have guaranteed her a spot in a tournament where she would likely meet Ronnie O Sullivan, which she greatly desired, as, that way, she could test her new Defensive skills out. She had to grow the adequate mindset, let alone the adequate skills to begin standing a chance against players like Ricky, who constantly frustrated, beat and, almost bullied her everytime she did not clean the table. So... she did. Armed with Cast Iron patience and an Intense gaze that lurks right from her stuffed armchair with a glass of water to the face... directly into the opponents soul, she gnaws at them... tiring... almost teasing... as a kind of competitive payback against everyone who bested her in defense before. Then... Its Ricky's shot. He takes it. After aiming, the cueball parts somewhere between the bottom left cushion and the yellow spot into nudged between  red and the top cushion. He takes it and... in Walden fashion... He nails it. Then .. its Komaks turn... who... despite the competitive facade, taps with the tip of her bizarrely made out of Cast iron cue on the table as acknowledgement. She puts a special kind of manganese powder-esque chalk in the tip... roams and roams... "Are you serious??? *sigh...* come on Komak... come on" Then... she gets an idea. She sees a way. She immediatly goes to the top cushion and... her pre shot swings are wide... very wide and fast... how much force is she putting on it??? But... she takes it. It hits the top left cushion, the top right cushion... at incredible speed, nudging a red that was stranded in the middle part of the table... making the white ball bounce on the bottom cushion and... arriving almost completly dead still, get almost glued to... the brown ball that was close to the left bottom cushion. The audience claps and cheers at our cyborg maid... and Komak then smirks at Walden with that dreaded intense, amber gaze.. not even feeling sheepish at the concentration drool she proceedes to wipe off her mouth with a thumb* *A bit of the post match interview mentioning the 3rd frame* "And Ms Komak! What was that shot a few hours ago? Certainly someone of your caliber would not hesitate in saying it was all planned out! Would I be guessing correctly?" "Not... not really.... you know... Even at this level... potting basic balls requires almost chronic training to do consistently? Know those black and red balls I was potting in my 90 point break in the first frame? Yeah... those are the ones I talk about. Let alone predict what happens after 1 cushion. And after 2 cushions? Its complete hit and hope. Complete and utter hit and hope. I had to get somewhat lucky for the shot to work. Thats half the reason I smirked at Walden... like: "Hehe... sorry about that, mate. But now its your turn". No actually proud player would ever tell you that my shot was 100% planned. Any player that tells you this is bad at lying and probably bluffing."


*Job offer in card Komak's employers go around distributing around town*
Hello guys. I am Komak the Maid. I am from russia, 47. I am a mechanical maid. I provide mechanical services and pleasentries at Firmino's garage down town.

My prosthetic metal had does not give a damn about finger discomfort so its good! Those are also jobs performed by the precise hands of a seasoned professional snooker player (currently rank 21 inside this year, 30th overall). This mechanical maid is also pretty passionate about Komak's job! Komak does rally in her spare time... going on escapades in the woods surrounding the center of town. I drive a subaru wrx 555 special, my pride and joy, with turbos installed by me! Its reliable and its 8 years old and still kicking since the first time I got my hands on its 4th ownership. I maintain it with care, and challenge it! The perfect mix to grow machines with personality! So come pay us a visit. Because you certainly shouldnt need to pay much to maintain your own mechanical baby running real smooth!






A snippet of reflections of Komak the Maid during therapy:


"So... what brings you here today, Ms. Komak? by the way... congratulations on reaching the semi-finals of the gibraltar tournament last sunday... it was just a shame you could not get it done... even this time"

"yeah... Judd Trump is tough to beat. Always makes the right calls, he is flawless offensively, fearless defensively,  he begins to do those flairy tricks that intimidate you... and his face is cold like a stone while he is in the zone..."

"A bit like yourself?"

*blushing* "R- really? do I really exude that kind of... presence?"

"I surprises me it isnt that obvious... I mean... the steel cue, the anti-slip magnesium powder instead of chalk, the odd way with which you set up your shots, your absurdly fast pace of play... its all frightening. His dynamism may be overwhelming... but your ruthless efficiency is unsettling... but enough of that. You've actually hit a very good run of form in tournaments recently! I mean... going off only on semi's in a stacked tournament, having amassed over 13k pounds in prize money from the previous 2 tournaments alone... your life should be roses... and yet... you called me last night... you told me you felt anxious and its usually me who reminds you of our sessions, Ms Komak. So... what happened?"

"Its just... Doctor... I... I... just... feel this strange thing at night where my chest cant stop aching and my heart cant stopr racing... I cant sleep. I try to imagine myself being consoled and even... sexualized by people and... caregiving doesnt work, erotic advances dont work and I cant imagine myself comfortable anywhere in any way... I tap my foot while waiting for my opponent to finish... I was even advised by some judges that I was going to get disqualified if I did not stop, I tap my foot while eating, I tap my foot in the grocery store... I tap my foot everywhere... and its not all! Just listen to this! this... this... this cannot be normal! Right after the tournament, right after a 7 day long tournament with 2 hour matches and... and... and so much stuff and people... and thinking and everything... I just went home to my tree house, grabbed my helmet, opened the shutter for my shed-like garage, turned the key on my subaru and went rallying! It was 1 am! One AM! So then I went back home... all dirty and worked up and everything! Adrenaline pumping from rallying my battered car in the forest in pitch black darkness in a car with no working high beams... And I actually skipped that night! I could not sleep to save my life! In the morning, when I woke up, I went to smoke outside immediatly. Then I went to have breakfast, where I actually mixed a bunch of coffee with my eggs... and after washing my teeth and putting on my attire, calibrating my arm... I went back into rallying! It was 8 am! And I was sleepless! After I- This... this isnt normal, right? And when my computer took just a bit too long to start up, I almost punched it using my mechanical arm! So I punched my wall instead... and now I have a new beam on the treehouse to mend, otherwise the whole thing is gonna fall... So I got so mad I went to- and I havent explained this yet. But I have also found ANOTHER job... like this is the problem! I cant sit still for a second! This cant be normal! I think my body will give someday! So to stop thinking about that, I have found a job where I work as a sort of... freelancer... mechanical maid... automotive shop assistant thing, where I teach people how to do the ECU, help them choose a turbocharger, help them install said turbo charger... help by changing the oil... and clean the garage... but its not too specific... thats why I consider myself as a maid. I do work, obviously I get paid, but its mostly very scattered... as I really just want to have my hands on something firm, something firm I can touch and keep myself busy with. Wether it is screwing down a new wing for a client's time attack car, fixing up a side mirror, undenting a hood... its soo good! I... I just feel horrible when I stop... I feel horrible... An-"

*therapist interrupts her... or she would just not stop. Its been like this for the past 4 sessions. But only this time was it Komak to address the therapist directly*
