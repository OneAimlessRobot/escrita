Song: Hati
Desc: Polyneuropathy is a possible symptom caused by lots of drug abuse. Hati is a mythological creature from norse culture. Its a white wolf that chases the dark. There is also Skoll which is a black wolf that chases the light. Its basically a norse version of yin-yang.

Album Helios
Yakui the Maid
Desc: Yakui the maid often creates music with very melancholic themes or (logical or) energy or (logical or) melodies. Heat, end of school, boredom, slowness, dryness, droughts among other things are sometimes associated with Summer. Heat. Sun. Helios. The feeling of being so tired and sluggish that all you can do is walk while looking down and all you can focus on are the small tarmac pebbles on the road/sidewalk, really hard, scorching hot, peppered with equally hard and hot loose pebbles... the slightest trip and hit on the ground will scrape your limbs, everything seems so far, you hear nothing on your head. You are sweaty, you are unmmotivated. You can barely open your eyes. Hot. Sun.Helios

Yakui the Maid
Album Helios
Song Helios
By 6:45am, an ominous object appears and it lights up a line in the sky. Its a big blob of electric gas. Its the closest thing to a thermonuclear landscape we have near. Its core temperature is in the 7digits. All praise the unforgiving god of the sun, who has risen from slumber once again. He watches. His energy overwhelming energy raining on us relentlessly, cooking us alive mercilessly.

Yakui the Maid
Album Polyneuropathy
Song: Drain
Desc: Remember: Yakui is the Drug addict maid. Here we go: "My soul and my body are a toilet. A sewer inlet. Everyday, more grime, sludge and filth pours into and gets flushed out of my toilet. Sometimes empty. Never full. Like since I was born.

Album: Watching slice of life to heal
(by) Throne
It sounds drastic. It sounds wounded and in pain. It hysterically laughts despite it all, pushing forward relentlessly and with full force, with a mix of despair and determination in the heart. You can only feel violent gusts of wind as you dash down through the sky, looking for a microbe of a target for a possibility of survival. Feels like DOOM. Feels like a journey out of hell. It sounds as real as the pebbles in the sidewalk that you step on and feel in your feet near gravel roads. Great stuff.
