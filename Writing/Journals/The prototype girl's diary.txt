I like this song.

Scythe the Luna x Yakui the maid - Welcome Home My Master
"Watashi wa tan'naru dejitarugārudesuga, sore wa jūyōdesu ka?
lyrics
Turn me online..
Take me beyond up and high.
LED luminescence, server acceptable lag.
I’m always ready
For the one more frag!

Welcome home my master.
Don`t mind it`s whole disaster? -
Outdated crystal castle,
That never knows the best.

I am eternal maiden,
The shallow light is fading.
You`re not alone in darkness,
Please lay your head and rest

On my knees, uneven breathe.
Give me kiss.. Oh please don`t
Hesitate, before too late,
My systems freeze in corrupted state!

Through shattered lenses I see,
Forgotten endless dream -
In dying shades of light,
Self-righteous suicide.

Pitch higher soundwave,
There`s nothing for myself,
But only for you.

“In deepest hell of abyss
Was everything fine?”
Press replay, start the game,
Are you now satisfied?

I want to serve your orders,
Thrill touching virtual skin.
But I can`t step out this border,
Something shudder within!

Awaiting your orders!
I’m broken,
Can’t hold it anymore!

Turn me online..
I fall beyond the skyline.
If this place not worth to stay,
Take me with you far away..

Let me stay..
Don`t go away.."
