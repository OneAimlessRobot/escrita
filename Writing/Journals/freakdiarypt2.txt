You know? I did not like the turbulence of my infancy. But I like the result. This is what I am now and I have no regrets


"Come on! Just sit still and quietly down watching the other team play, Filipa!" SHUT UP! FINE JUST GIVE ME A BENCH TO SIT AND... I WILL PROBABLY GET UP IMMEDIATLY TO CATWALK AIMLESSLY AGAIN *Catwalk by Naite the maid starts playing*



"So you think you are the main character, huh?! Very funny! No one is the main character! In this world we are all pathetic! Just accept it! Like... you cant even prove you are the main character!" No...  no i cant. But YOU ALSO CANNOT PROVE THAT I AM NOT! So I will just believe it! I will believe it and crash into every wall that appears in my path filled with a burning desire to become awesome! And I will actually become awesome! Im not gonna just stand and hide behind a screen like a office worker! Im not gonna hide from pain behind layers of abstraction like a stupid dumb philosopher! I wont hide behind sarcasm and cynnicism like a talk show commedian! I am not gonna achieve awesomeness to just have it! Because I BELIVE I AM THE MAIN CHARACTER SO I! AM! THE MAIN CHARACTER! AND WHEN MAIN CHARACTERS DO MAIN CHARACTER SHIT, EVERYTHING BECOMES POSSIBLE, MILLIONS OF COLOURS SUDDENTLY FILL EVERYONES EYES AND INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL THINGS HAPPEN! IM NOT GONNA ACHIEVE, DISSOCIATE OR CONQUER! I WILL BECOME AWESOMENESS ITSELF! I AM FILIPA!


One for a very cocky girl: "So anyways... I score my shitty tap in right? So then... what Filipa, the queen of earth does is, stamp on the ground with her dominant tree trunk leg, like stomping on an ant, then point down. 'stay down! SHUSH! STAY DOWN' Walk away pointing at that spot. Trot to a camera, blow a kiss do a bit of hip dancing grabbing my own hair, then smile in a cocky way, spelling out "LGHF (let girls have fun, a popular meme on my socials)" On the camera using a very think lip gloss I carry with me just for this specific ocasion."

Filipa! you hear this? The man says that YOU SLAY! Filipa: "What else was he suposed to say?"


Omg people are so ANNOYING WITH YOUR GAYS AND TRANS AND LGBTQIH TV HD 1080!!!!! I AM more of a LPHF kinda person, ya know? As in... LET PEOPLE HAVE FUN!


You bet. Next up is filipa! A hyperactive  dynamo psychic with a persona mixed with goofy and edgy with one hell of an attitude. She is bi, she is teasable and she enjoys going blow for blow with whoever as long as they keep up! Dont get too close (she can pick locks remotely with telekinesis so it does not really matter... also she is not really repressed, she just really loves f***ing. And she takes no prisioners!). She enjoys programming, bodybuilding and sports! She is somehow both kind and aloof, loves asking weird ass questions and analyzing people, is curious, both braindead goofy and philosopher deep. She has difficulty adulting and is a huge brat. She wears hoodies anytime she is not playing sports (excluding showers and beach but thats about it!). People complain about what they perceive as childishness, recklessness or even arrogance. Wherever she goes she always has the look of someone who has genuenly already seen it all! If she feels you dont give her enough affection, she will come back home and rage journal about you, but if she then hears knocking on her door, because she is so hyperfixated on everyone she has  met or spoken to during the day, specially you, she will drop everything and... "Omg... these flowers....they are ugly! *adjusts them* My bed is a mess! *Speedruns making her bed, fetches drinks, fetches food, makes table* *Opens door while looking like crap* *Its... the mailman... with the playing card set she ordered like 2 months ago*. Also... she is 21 (F), 175cm, 78kg, very muscular on the legs, somewhat ignores arms, built back and core. My god she looks like mewtwo! Legs are soo out of porportion with the rest... Thats what she wants though so..., She wears cargo pants, sneakers, hoodies, has jade retinaless eyes, small nose, always has a distant aloof look on her face which is absolutely different from how she engages with people, with her witty, visceral and raw charm. Playful and clumsy. Very upset at "casuals". Very distracteable and teasable. Has received lots of complaints from the people she speaks to that she is way too....blunt and raw and bordering on inconsiderate sometimes (and many times, even if only trying to have fun, very inconsiderate). Ok I think thats all


How I do B pullin up:

*Suddently.... on the top of a roof.... 10 meters away... with a slightly spread out leg stance...wearing a hoodie... trainers... sneakers... and my god THAT ACNE! MY GOD, GIRL! GO TO A PHARMACY AND GET SOME SOAP! JESUS! Anyways... bright green eyes sparkling from within the darkness of the hood covered face... a plain hood, some jeans and long hair running from inside the head covering fabric. with hands on pant pockets... with a cocky smirk visible from the unshaded part of their face... Looking confident. Then... she... takes of her hood... Its... its..." FILIPA BIIITTTCHHHH!!!"*


HELL YES CARALHO! RAPIDA COMO UM RAIO! COMBUSTIVEL G.P.Lipa!
