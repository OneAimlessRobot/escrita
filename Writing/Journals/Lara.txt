Laras diary goes here


*Appointment with Dr. Ramani*

*So... basically, what happened is that Lara wanted to start sorting out her life, but she had no idea where to begin. But she could not get advice from her mother, for obvious reasons. She had 1 thing to work with: She had a hunch that she was... an airhead. So... she looked up descriptions online of what that could entail and one that came up was, Attention Deficit Innatentive Disorder that she, conveniently for plot, chose to leverage for dear life to escape her dazed nightmare of a life. And she watched alot of Ramani Lectures... and was captivated by her straightforwardness, matter-of-fact speech and know-around in psychology. So she spent her entire summer trying to find where she works at, ommiting everything from her mother this entire time. So eventually, they end up meeting up, Lara gets in Ramani's office... and this is how it goes*

L=Lara
R=Ramani

L- H- Hello... R- Ramani.
R- *Evaluating Lara. Her look is unimpressed... almost defensive and cautious. She *just knows* what the problem is, because of course she does* Hello! What brings you here today? *presses recording button on her smartphone on her lap... keeping her hands hidden from Lara this entire time. Lara does not know a thing about therapy meetings so she thinks this is normal.*
L- I... uhhh... sorry... I... ok.... Wait... let me think...
R- *Thinks: "Look at her... what an airhead... She is at least a cluster B... lets see if she gets worse though...*
L- *Feels unconfortable and awkward* Uhhhhh what... what do I say? Ok... I think... I am sorta... sad when I.... uhhh... Ramani... I think you are very smart... so I came here... and thats it...
R- *Does not articulate Goals, spaced out and dazed and look at those breasts... at least 15 hundred dollars on surgery. What a hoe... she just has to be an HPD... all exhibicionistic... what an absolute viper...*
L- R- Ramani... 
R- *Sigh... another stupid princess crawls into my office* *blurted it out*
L- *Gasps* R- Ramani?
R- *No! She is onto me! Shes gonna start seducing me now! Activate counter measures!* Miss... your eyes... are very pretty! And that golden hair! Is that essential oils? Snake? Camel saliva? Those surgeries...
L- W- What?
R- *What? Its not working? What is she made of? Rocks and sticks? Ok Im wiping the floor with her thats it.* Look: Bitch. I hate when creepy crawlies with pretty looks and shit brains wander into my office just to get attention. Dont waste my time or I will take away that sly, cunning smile of yours you python!
L- *Speechless*
R- What? Did I touch a nerve? I hope I also hammered it... Dont wanna leave anything left... *giggles*
L- W- What?
R- Dont try to fool me! You came to my office because your parents are tired of feeding spineless, make up obcessed princesses like you!
L- *Already has tears in her eyes... perserveers... "Should therapy really be like this?"* I- I have ADID!
R- *Scoffs* Oh really? *Leans closer* Explain... airhead!
L- Ok... I read a description and I am an airhead so it made sen-
R- BULLSHIT! You are just making up excuses for having the soul of a wasp! A fruit fly! just looking for the sweetest smell! You really do piss me off...
L- Uhhh... Do I still... have to pay?
R- That depends... if you want to start acting right... I think you should... Like... the way you speak... the way you dress... the way you think... I mean... you can barely call that thinking. Id say its just... warming up your scalp but nothing is really happening inside, is it? I dont know like...  It seems you are okay but at the same time I dont know if you have NPD, HPD or if your brain is just shit!
L- *Crying...* Im... *Sobs* Im not s- shit...
R- *Shakes head in cold disapproval* Lousy party goer
L- What? B- But I hate parties!
R- Uhhhhh... look what we have here! A misunderstood introvert who does not like parties? Those big breasts really do suggest it! Its like every move you make is to get a man to dig out your entrails through that nasty cave between your legs... 
L- No... this is not right... this... this... t- THIS IS NOT RIGHT! I HAVE ADID! I DO! I DO! I WONT LET UP UNDERSTAND?! I NEED YOUR HELP! YOU ARE SMART AND RELIABLE AND I AM NOT SO I NEED YOU! PLEASE HELP ME! I DONT UNDERSTAND! YOU ARE SUPOSED TO HELP ME! HUMANS ARE SUPOSED TO BE GOOD! WHY DOES EVERYONE LOOK LIKE MOMMA?! WHY?! WHY CANT I ESCAPE MOMMA?! ITS IN THE TESTS, THE BUS, THE TRAIN, THE HOUSE AND THEEEEM IN THERAPY?!*



*Author notes*


This is lara. Homo bewilderus: An 
Ignorant. But charming creature.

Lara calculating 3.28 times 5:


"I know that... I know its 15 plus something. Ok... 28 fits 3 times inside 1. And 3 times 28 is 30-6 so we get 84. We have 15.84. Then we have 2 0.28s remaining. Its between 15 and 16"


"My favourite soccer club is... AJAX from the Netherlands."


life update: Lara wants to be a kindergarden educator. Dealing with children, mutually exchanging imaginary worlds, dynamising activities... fun with them in the cafeteria... answering their questions with more questions... somehow... being called an idiot by a child does not feel cruel. It feels... healing. Comfortable. Grounding. She is not good at office work or sitting still for hours in the same spot. She would rotate between different age groups at the kindergarden facility, every 2 hours or so, to keep herself and, following from that, the children, more engaged. She likes taking care of childrens bruises... and to tell off kids who badmouth others.
She wants to... make it right.


During the night, she used to have nightmarea where... she was in a forest. The trees... they spoke, they had wholes in their grand, imposing and solid trunks, resembling faces that moved and warped. Inside them.... an endless, pitch black void. The trees... they would grow taller... and more of them would appear every night... Talking over eachother... talking loudly... harshly... yelling... like her mother. Calling the same names. "Just like mother". So... after those nights, she would skip school... and go to the nearest forest... by sneaking into a bus... so she could go talk... to trees. But... These trees... they cant talk. They have thin trunks, no mouths or eyes... no endless voids. They did not yell... all they did... was a ruffling sound from the wind... leaves picked up from them by the wind hit her face... and she smiles. walking around... she can see foxes sneaking into bushes at the level of her feet, deer... some bears that dont approach her... "Bears are nice... they dont hurt us... unprovoke... they are our friends."
The can see sunlight... beneath the foliage... pierced by several silvery light beams... in these temperate woods. Bark trees... Eucalyptus, bushes, grapes, strawberries, red berries... olives... and... no yelling. Just the sounds from the gravel that her feet slide over with each curious step, peeking over each tree... until she finds a shack. In that shack, she finds... a maid. Smoking in a balcony. Its a wooden treehouse. Komak the Maid... lives in a treehouse. And the two... finally meet.
